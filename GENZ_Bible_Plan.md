# GENZ Bible Translation Plan

## Overview
Create a GENZ/Slang translation of the Bible using the web.txt version as the source text. The translation will maintain biblical accuracy while incorporating contemporary GenZ slang and expressions.

## Project Structure
1. **Enhanced Slang Mappings** - Expand the existing slang dictionary
2. **Translation Guidelines** - Rules for maintaining accuracy

### Translation Rules
