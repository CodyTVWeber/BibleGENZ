# Genesis Chapter 1

  1. At the start, God created the heavens and the earth.
  2. The earth was low-key chaotic and empty—darkness covered the deep, and God’s Spirit was hovering over the waters like a quiet vibe before the drop.
  3. God was like, “Let there be light,” and light pulled up.
  4. God checked out the light and saw it was fire, so he separated the light from the darkness.
  5. God named the light “Day” and the darkness “Night.” Evening rolled in and morning showed up—that was day one.
  6. God was like, “Let there be a space between the waters to separate waters from waters.”
  7. So God made the expanse and split the waters—some up above, some down below. And that’s how it went.
  8. God named the expanse “Sky.” Evening rolled in and morning showed up—that was day two.
  9. God was like, “Let the waters under the sky slide together into one place so dry land can show up.” And that’s what happened.
 10. God named the dry land “Earth,” and the gathered waters “Seas.” God checked it out and said, “That’s fire.”
 11. God was like, “Earth, grow green things—plants making seeds and trees making fruit with seeds inside, each according to its kind.” And the earth did the thing.
 12. The earth sprouted plants with seeds and trees with fruit, each according to its kind. God saw the whole scene and it was fire.
 13. Evening rolled in and morning showed up—that was day three.
 14. God was like, “Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night, and to mark seasons, days, and years.”
 15. “Let them shine down on the earth.” And boom, lights turned on.
 16. God made two big lights—the stronger one to run the day and the softer one to run the night—and he also made the stars, just flexing.
 17. God set them in the sky to light up the earth,
 18. to manage day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God looked and said, “That’s fire.”
 19. Evening rolled in and morning showed up—that was day four.
 20. God was like, “Water, team up with living things—let it be swarming—and sky, let birds come through and fly across the open sky.”
 21. So God created the big sea creatures and every living thing that moves in the waters, and every winged bird—each according to its kind. God checked it out and said, “That’s fire.”
 22. God blessed them up and said, “Be fruitful—multiply—fill the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.”
 23. Evening rolled in and morning showed up—that was day five.
 24. God was like, “Earth, produce living creatures—livestock, wild things, and every crawler on the ground—each according to its kind.” And it happened like that.
 25. God made the wild animals, the livestock, and everything that creeps on the ground, each according to its kind. God saw it and called it fire.
 26. Then God was like, “Let’s make humans in our image, looking like us, so they can run point over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the livestock, the wild animals, and everything that crawls.”
 27. So God created humans in his own image; in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.
 28. God blessed them up and said, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and run it. Rule over the fish, the birds, and every living thing that moves on the ground.”
 29. God was like, “Look, I’m hooking you up with every seed-bearing plant on the earth and every tree with seed-bearing fruit—that’s your food.”
 30. “And to every animal of the earth, every bird of the sky, and everything that crawls that has the breath of life—I’m giving every green plant for food.” And that’s how it went.
 31. God checked out everything he had made, and it was hella fire—very good. Evening rolled in and morning showed up—that was the sixth day.
