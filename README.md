## BibleGENZ Output

Important: ALPHA PREVIEW

This is an alpha version of a GENZ-first slang rendering of the Bible. It was generated from the public-domain World English Bible (WEB) base text using local, rule-based mappings. Expect rough edges, uneven tone, and places where phrasing can be improved. We actively welcome collaboration from humans and from AI-assisted editors to refine the slang, improve consistency, and keep meaning faithful to the source.

How to collaborate (humans and AI):
- Edit slang mappings in `Enhanced_Slang_Mappings.json` to propose better terms and phrase swaps
- Open pull requests with improvements to specific chapters under `genz_bible/`
- File issues with examples where tone, clarity, or reverence should be adjusted
- Suggest tests or guidelines that keep slang authentic to Gen Z while preserving theological meaning
