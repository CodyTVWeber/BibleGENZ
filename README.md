## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Bible Splitting
The original `web.txt` (World English Bible) was split into 1,189 separate chapter files organized by book and chapter.

### 2. Slang Mapping
Comprehensive slang dictionaries were created with 5 categories:
- **Spiritual Terms**: "blessed" → "blessed up", "sin" → "messing up"
- **Emotional Terms**: "rejoice" → "be hyped", "good" → "fire"
- **Action Terms**: "speak" → "spill the tea", "see" → "check it out"
- **Modern Expressions**: "truly" → "deadass", "because" → "cuz"
- **Biblical Phrases**: "God said" → "God was like", "behold" → "check this out"

### 3. Automated Translation
A Python script systematically applied slang mappings while preserving:
- Biblical names (God, Jesus, Moses, etc.)
- Theological accuracy
- Verse structure and numbering
- Chapter organization
