# Jonah Chapter 2

  1. then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish’s belly.
  2. He said, “I called cuz of my affliction to Yahweh. He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried. ya heard my voice.
  3. For ya threw me into the depths, in the heart of the seas. The flood was all around me. All your waves and your billows passed over me.
  4. I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your set apart God's house.’
  5. The waters surrounded me, even to the soul. The deep was around me. The weeds were wrapped around my head.
  6. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth barred me in forever: yet have ya brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God.
  7. “When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh. My talking to God came in to ya, into your set apart God's house.
  8. Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
  9. But I will giving it up to ya with the voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that which I have vowed. getting saved belongs to Yahweh.”
 10. Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.
