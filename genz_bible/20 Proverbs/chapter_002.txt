  4. If ya seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures:
  5. then ya will understand the fear of Yahweh, and find the knowledge of God.
  6. For Yahweh gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
  7. He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;
  8. that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of his set apart fam.

 15. who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths:
 16. To deliver ya from the strange woman, even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;
 17. who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the God's promise of her God:
 18. for her house leads down to death, her paths to the dead.
