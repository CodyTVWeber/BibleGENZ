# 1 Corinthians Chapter 8

  1. now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We get it that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but show love builds up.
  2. But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet get it as he ought to get it.
  3. But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.
  4. so basically concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we get it that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
  5. For though there are things that are called “gods,” whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are a lot “gods” and a lot “lords;”
  6. yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one boss, Jesus the huge set apart, through whom are all things, and we live through him.
  7. but like, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being not it, is defiled.
  8. But food won't commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.
  9. But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the not it.
 10. For if a man sees ya who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s God's house, won’t his conscience, if he is not it, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
 11. And through your knowledge, he who is not it perishes, the fam bro for whose sake the huge set apart died.
 12. Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is not it, ya messing up against the huge set apart.
 13. so basically, if food causes my fam bro to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don’t cause my fam bro to stumble.
