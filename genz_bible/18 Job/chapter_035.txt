# Job Chapter 35

    1. Moreover Elihu answered,
    2. “Do ya think this to be your right, or do ya say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’
    3. That ya ask, ‘What advantage will it be to ya? What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’
    4. I will answer ya, and your companions with ya.
    5. Look to the heavens, and check it out. check it out the skies, which are higher than ya.
    6. If ya have sinned, what effect do ya have against him? If your transgressions are multiplied, what do ya do to him?
    7. If ya are doing what's right, what do ya hook it up him? Or what does he receive from your hand?
    8. Your wickedness may hurt a man as ya are, and your righteousness may profit a son of man.
    9. “By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out. They cry for help out out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
  10. But none says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
  11. who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’
  12. there they cry, but none gives answer, cuz of the pride of evil men.
  13. Surely God won't hear an empty cry, neither will the Almighty regard it.
  14. How much less when ya say ya don’t check it out him. The cause is before him, and ya wait for him!
  15. But now, cuz he has not visited in his anger, neither does he greatly regard arrogance.
  16. so basically Job opens his mouth with empty talk, and he multiplies words without knowledge.”
