# Job Chapter 17

    1. “My spirit is consumed. My days are extinct, And the grave is ready for me.
    2. Surely there are huge meanies with me. My eye dwells on their provocation.
    3. “now hook it up a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself. Who is there who will strike hands with me?
    4. For ya have hidden their heart from understanding, so basically ya won't exalt them.
    5. He who denounces his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.
    6. “But he has made me a byword of the people. They spit in my face.
    7. My eye also is dim by reason of feeling down. All my members are as a shadow.
    8. Upright men shall be astonished at this. The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
    9. Yet shall the doing what's right hold on his way. He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.
  10. But as for ya all, come through through on now again; I won't find a smart man among ya.
  11. My days are past, my plans are broken off, as are the thoughts of my heart.
  12. They change the night into day, saying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness.
  13. If I look for Sheol as my house, if I have spread my couch in the darkness,
  14. If I have said to corruption, ‘ya are my father;’ to the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘my sister;’
  15. where then is my hope? as for my hope, who shall check it out it?
  16. Shall it slide down with me to the gates of Sheol, or descend together into the dust?”
