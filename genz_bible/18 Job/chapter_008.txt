# Job Chapter 8

    1. then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
    2. “How long will ya spill the tea these things? Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
    3. Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
    4. If your children have sinned against him, He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.
    5. If ya want to seek God diligently, create your supplication to the Almighty.
    6. If ya were pure and upright, surely now he would awaken for ya, and create the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.
    7. Though your beginning was tiny, yet your latter end would greatly increase.
    8. “Please inquire of past generations. Find out about the learning of their fathers.
    9. (For we are but of yesterday, and get it nothing, cuz our days on earth are a shadow.)
  10. Shall they not drop knowledge ya, tell ya, and utter words out of their heart?
  11. “Can the papyrus grow up without mire? Can the rushes grow without water?
  12. While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, it withers before any other reed.
  13. So are the paths of all who forget God. The hope of the godless man shall perish,
  14. Whose confidence shall break apart, Whose trust is a spider’s web.
  15. He shall lean on his house, but it won't stand. He shall cling to it, but it won't endure.
  16. He is green before the sun. His shoots slide forth over his garden.
  17. His roots are wrapped around the rock pile. He sees the place of stones.
  18. If he is destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen ya.’
  19. check this out, this is the joy of his way: out of the earth, others shall spring.
  20. “check this out, God won't cast away a blameless man, neither will he uphold the evildoers.
  21. He will still fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting.
  22. Those who can't stand ya shall be clothed with shame. The tent of the wicked shall be no more.”
