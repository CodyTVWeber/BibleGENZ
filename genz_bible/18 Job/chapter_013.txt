  4. But ya are forgers of lies. ya are all physicians of no value.
  5. Oh that ya would be completely silent! then ya would be smart.
  6. Hear now my reasoning. listen up to the pleadings of my lips.
  7. Will ya spill the tea unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?
  8. Will ya show partiality to him? Will ya contend for God?
  9. Is it fire that he should search ya out? Or as one deceives a man, will ya deceive him?
 10. He will surely reprove ya if ya secretly show partiality.
 11. won't his majesty create ya scared, And his dread fall on ya?
 12. Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay.

 23. How a lot are my iniquities and sins? create me get it my disobedience and my messing up.
 24. Why hide ya your face, and hold me for your enemy?
 25. Will ya harass a driven leaf? Will ya pursue the dry stubble?
 26. For ya write bitter things against me, and create me inherit the iniquities of my youth:
 27. ya also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths. ya set a bound to the soles of my feet,
 28. though I am decaying like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
