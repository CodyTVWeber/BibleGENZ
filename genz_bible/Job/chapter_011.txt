# Job Chapter 11

  1. then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,
  2. “Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered? Should a man full of talk be justified?
  3. Should your boastings create men hold their peace? When ya mock, shall no man create ya ashamed?
  4. For ya say, ‘My doctrine is pure. I am clean in your eyes.’
  5. But oh that God would spill the tea, and open his lips against ya,
  6. that he would show ya the secrets of wisdom! For true wisdom has two sides. get it so basically that God exacts of ya less than your iniquity deserves.
  7. “Can ya fathom the mystery of God? Or can ya probe the limits of the Almighty?
  8. They are high as heaven. What can ya do? They are deeper than Sheol. What can ya get it?
  9. Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
 10. If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?
 11. For he knows false men. He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn’t consider it.
 12. An empty-headed man becomes smart when a man is born as a wild donkey’s colt.
 13. “If ya set your heart aright, stretch out your hands toward him.
 14. If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away. Don’t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.
 15. Surely then ya shall lift up your face without spot; Yes, ya shall be steadfast, and won't fear:
 16. for ya shall forget your misery. ya shall remember it as waters that are passed away.
 17. Life shall be clearer than the noonday. Though there is darkness, it shall be as the morning.
 18. ya shall be secure, cuz there is hope. Yes, ya shall search, and shall grab your rest in safety.
 19. Also ya shall lie down, and none shall create ya scared. Yes, a lot shall court your favor.
 20. But the eyes of the wicked shall fail. They shall have no way to flee. Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit.”
