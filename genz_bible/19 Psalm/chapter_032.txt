# Psalm Chapter 32

    1. By David. A contemplative psalm. blessed up up is he whose disobedience is forgiven, whose messing up is covered.
    2. blessed up up is the man to whom Yahweh doesn’t impute iniquity, in whose spirit there is no deceit.
    3. When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
    4. For day and night your hand was heavy on me. My strength was sapped in the heat of summer. Selah.
    5. I acknowledged my messing up to ya. I didn’t hide my iniquity. I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh, and ya forgave the iniquity of my messing up. Selah.
    6. For this, let everyone who is godly pray to ya in a time when ya may be found. Surely when the major waters overflow, they won't reach to him.
    7. ya are my hiding place. ya will preserve me from trouble. ya will surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
    8. I will instruct ya and drop knowledge ya in the way which ya shall slide. I will counsel ya with my eye on ya.
    9. Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding, who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they won't come through through near to ya.
  10. a lot sorrows come through through to the wicked, but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh.
  11. Be glad in Yahweh, and be hyped, ya doing what's right! Shout for joy, all ya who are upright in heart!
