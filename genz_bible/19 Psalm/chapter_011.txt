# Psalm Chapter 11

    1. For the Chief Musician. By David. In Yahweh, I grab refuge. How can ya say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain!”
    2. For, check this out, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
    3. If the foundations are destroyed, what can the doing what's right do?
    4. Yahweh is in his yeeted God's house. Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe. His eyes examine the children of men.
    5. Yahweh examines the doing what's right, but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.
    6. On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
    7. For Yahweh is doing what's right. He loves righteousness. The upright shall check it out his face.
