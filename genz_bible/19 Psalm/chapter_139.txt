# Psalm Chapter 139

  1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. Yahweh, ya have searched me, and ya get it me.
  2. ya get it my sitting down and my rising up. ya perceive my thoughts from afar.
  3. ya search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.
  4. For there isn't a word on my tongue, but, check this out,, Yahweh, ya get it it altogether.
  5. ya hem me in behind and before. ya laid your hand on me.
  6. This knowledge is beyond me. It’s lofty. I can’t attain it.
  7. Where could I slide from your Spirit? Or where could I flee from your presence?
  8. If I ascend up into heaven, ya are there. If I create my bed in Sheol, check this out,, ya are there!
  9. If I grab the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea;
 10. Even there your hand will show the way me, and your right hand will hold me.
 11. If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me; the light around me will be night;”
 12. even the darkness doesn’t hide from ya, but the night shines as the day. The darkness is like light to ya.
 13. For ya formed my inmost being. ya knit me together in my mother’s womb.
 14. I will hook it up thanks to ya, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. My soul knows that hella well.
 15. My frame wasn’t hidden from ya, when I was made in secret, woven together in the depths of the earth.
 16. Your eyes saw my body. In your book they were all written, the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were none of them.
 17. How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is their sum!
 18. If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I wake up, I am still with ya.
 19. If only ya, God, would kill the wicked. Get away from me, ya bloodthirsty men!
 20. For they spill the tea against ya wickedly. Your enemies grab your name in vain.
 21. Yahweh, don’t I can't stand those who can't stand ya? Am I not grieved with those who rise up against ya?
 22. I can't stand them with perfect hatred. They have become my enemies.
 23. Search me, God, and get it my heart. Try me, and get it my thoughts.
 24. check it out if there is any wicked way in me, and show the way me in the everlasting way.
