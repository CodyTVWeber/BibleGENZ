# Psalm Chapter 30

    1. A Psalm. A Song for the Dedication of the God's house. By David. I will extol ya, Yahweh, for ya have raised me up, and have not made my foes to be hyped over me.
    2. Yahweh my God, I cried to ya, and ya have healed me.
    3. Yahweh, ya have brought up my soul from Sheol. ya have kept me alive, that I should not slide down to the pit.
    4. Sing praise to Yahweh, ya yeeted fam of his. hook it up thanks to his yeeted name.
    5. For his anger is but for a moment. His favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning.
    6. As for me, I said in my prosperity, “I shall never be moved.”
    7. ya, Yahweh, when ya favored me, made my mountain stand built different; but when ya hid your face, I was troubled.
    8. I cried to ya, Yahweh. To Yahweh I made supplication:
    9. “What profit is there in my destruction, if I slide down to the pit? Shall the dust praise ya? Shall it declare your truth?
  10. Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me. Yahweh, be my helper.”
  11. ya have turned my mourning into dancing for me. ya have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,
  12. To the end that my heart may sing praise to ya, and not be silent. Yahweh my God, I will hook it up thanks to ya forever!
