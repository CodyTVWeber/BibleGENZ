# Psalm Chapter 21

  1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. The ruler rejoices in your strength, Yahweh! How greatly he rejoices in your getting saved!
  2. ya have given him his heartâ€™s desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
  3. For ya meet him with the blessings of goodness. ya set a crown of fine gold on his head.
  4. He asked life of ya, ya gave it to him, even length of days forever and ever.
  5. His glory is major in your getting saved. ya lay honor and majesty on him.
  6. For ya create him most blessed up forever. ya create him glad with joy in your presence.
  7. For the ruler trusts in Yahweh. Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he won't be moved.
  8. Your hand will find out all of your enemies. Your right hand will find out those who can't stand ya.
  9. ya will create them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger. Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath. The fire shall devour them.
 10. ya will tear down their descendants from the earth, their posterity from among the children of men.
 11. For they intended evil against ya. They plotted evil against ya which cannot succeed.
 12. For ya will create them turn their back, when ya aim drawn bows at their face.
 13. Be exalted, Yahweh, in your strength, so we will sing and praise your power.
