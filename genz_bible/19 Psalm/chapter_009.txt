# Psalm Chapter 9

  1. For the Chief Musician. Set to “The Death of the Son.” A Psalm by David. I will hook it up thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart. I will tell of all your marvelous works.
  2. I will be glad and be hyped in ya. I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
  3. When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish in your presence.
  4. For ya have maintained my just cause. ya sit on the throne judging righteously.
  5. ya have rebuked the nations. ya have destroyed the wicked. ya have blotted out their name forever and ever.
  6. The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. The hella memory of the cities which ya have overthrown has perished.
  7. But Yahweh reigns forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment.
  8. He will judge the world in righteousness. He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
  9. Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed; a high tower in times of trouble.
 10. Those who get it your name will put their trust in ya, for ya, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek ya.
 11. Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion, and declare among the people what he has done.

 13. Have mercy on me, Yahweh. check it out my affliction by those who can't stand me, and lift me up from the gates of death;
 14. that I may show forth all your praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion, I will be hyped in your getting saved.
 15. The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.
 16. Yahweh has made himself known. He has executed judgment. The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. Meditation. Selah.
 17. The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God.
 18. For the needy won't always be forgotten, nor the hope of the broke perish forever.
 19. Arise, Yahweh! Don’t let man prevail. Let the nations be judged in your sight.
