# Psalm Chapter 70

    1. For the Chief Musician. By David. A reminder. Hurry, God, to deliver me. come through through quickly to help out out me, Yahweh.
    2. Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
    3. Let them be turned cuz of their shame Who say, “Aha! Aha!”
    4. Let all those who seek ya be hyped and be glad in ya. Let those who show show love your getting saved continually say, “Let God be exalted!”
    5. But I am broke and needy. come through through to me quickly, God. ya are my help out out and my deliverer. Yahweh, don’t delay.
