# Psalm Chapter 142

  1. A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave. A talking to God. I cry with my voice to Yahweh. With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.
  2. I pour out my complaint before him. I tell him my troubles.
  3. When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, ya knew my path. In the way in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.
  4. Look on my right, and check it out; for there is no one who is concerned for me. Refuge has fled from me. No one cares for my soul.
  5. I cried to ya, Yahweh. I said, “ya are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.”
  6. listen up to my cry, for I am in desperate need. deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than me.
  7. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may hook it up thanks to your name. The doing what's right will surround me, for ya will be fire to me.
