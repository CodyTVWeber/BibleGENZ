# Psalm Chapter 13

    1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. How long, Yahweh? Will ya forget me forever? How long will ya hide your face from me?
    2. How long shall I grab counsel in my soul, having feeling down in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me?
    3. check this out, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. hook it up light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;
    4. Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;” Lest my adversaries be hyped when I fall.
    5. But I trust in your loving kindness. My heart rejoices in your getting saved.
    6. I will sing to Yahweh, cuz he has been fire to me.
