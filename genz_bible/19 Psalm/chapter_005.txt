# Psalm Chapter 5

  1. For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David. hook it up ear to my words, Yahweh. Consider my meditation.
  2. listen up to the voice of my cry, my ruler and my God; for to ya do I pray.
  3. Yahweh, in the morning ya shall hear my voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before ya, and will watch expectantly.
  4. For ya aren't a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil canâ€™t live with ya.
  5. The arrogant won't stand in your sight. ya can't stand all workers of iniquity.
  6. ya will tear down those who spill the tea lies. Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
  7. But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come through into your house. I will bow toward your set apart God's house in reverence of ya.
  8. show the way me, Yahweh, in your righteousness cuz of my enemies. create your way straight before my face.
  9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their heart is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter with their tongue.
 10. Hold them guilty, God. Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against ya.
 11. But let all those who grab refuge in ya be hyped, Let them always shout for joy, cuz ya defend them. Let them also who show love your name be joyful in ya.
 12. For ya will bless the doing what's right. Yahweh, ya will surround him with favor as with a shield.
