    1. For the Chief Musician. A song. A Psalm. create a joyful shout to God, all the earth!
    2. Sing to the glory of his name! Offer glory and praise!
    3. Tell God, “How awesome are your deeds! Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to ya.
    4. All the earth will giving props ya, and will sing to ya; they will sing to your name.” Selah.
    5. come through through, and check it out God’s deeds—awesome work on behalf of the children of men.
    6. He turned the sea into dry land. They went through the river on foot. there, we rejoiced in him.
    7. He rules by his might forever. His eyes watch the nations. Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him. Selah.
    8. Praise our God, ya peoples! create the sound of his praise heard,
    9. who preserves our life among the living, and doesn’t allow our feet to be moved.
  10. For ya, God, have tested us. ya have refined us, as silver is refined.
  11. ya brought us into prison. ya laid a burden on our backs.
  12. ya allowed men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water, but ya brought us to the place of abundance.
  13. I will come through through into your God's house with burnt offerings. I will pay my vows to ya,
  14. which my lips promised, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.
  15. I will offer to ya burnt offerings of fat animals, with the giving to God of rams, I will offer bulls with goats. Selah.
  16. come through through, and hear, all ya who fear God. I will declare what he has done for my soul.
  17. I cried to him with my mouth. He was extolled with my tongue.
  18. If I cherished messing up in my heart, Boss wouldn’t have listened.
  19. But most for sure, God has listened. He has heard the voice of my talking to God.
  20. blessed up up be God, who has not turned away my talking to God, nor his loving kindness from me.
