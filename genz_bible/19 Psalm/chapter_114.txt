# Psalm Chapter 114

    1. When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language;
    2. Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
    3. The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan was driven back.
    4. The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.
    5. What was it, ya sea, that ya fled? ya Jordan, that ya turned back?
    6. ya mountains, that ya skipped like rams; ya little hills, like lambs?
    7. Tremble, ya earth, at the presence of Boss, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
    8. who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of waters.
