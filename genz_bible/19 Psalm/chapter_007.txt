# Psalm Chapter 7

    1. A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite. Yahweh, my God, I grab refuge in ya. rescue me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
    2. lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
    3. Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands,
    4. if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, if I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),
    5. let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.
    6. Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. ya have commanded judgment.
    7. Let the congregation of the peoples surround ya. Rule over them on high.
    8. Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me.
    9. Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come through through to an end, but establish the doing what's right; their minds and hearts are searched by the doing what's right God.
  10. My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
  11. God is a doing what's right judge, yes, a God who has indignation every day.
  12. If a man doesnâ€™t relent, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent and strung his bow.
  13. He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows.
  14. check this out, he travails with iniquity. Yes, he has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
  15. He has dug a hole, and has fallen into the pit which he made.
  16. The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come through through down on the crown of his own head.
  17. I will hook it up thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.
