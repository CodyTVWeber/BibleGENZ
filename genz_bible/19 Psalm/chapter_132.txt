    1. A Song of Ascents. Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,
    2. how he swore to Yahweh, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
    3. “Surely I won't come through through into the structure of my house, nor slide up into my bed;
    4. I won't hook it up sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids;
    5. until I find out a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
    6. check this out, we heard of it in Ephrathah. We found it in the field of Jaar:
    7. “We will slide into his dwelling place. We will giving props at his footstool.
    8. Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place; ya, and the ark of your strength.
    9. Let your priest be clothed with righteousness. Let your yeeted fam shout for joy!”
  10. For your helper David’s sake, don’t turn away the face of your the huge yeeted.
  11. Yahweh has sworn to David in truth. He won't turn from it: “I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.
  12. If your children will keep my God's promise, my testimony that I will drop knowledge them, their children also will sit on your throne forevermore.”
  13. For Yahweh has chosen Zion. He has desired it for his habitation.
  14. “This is my resting place forever. here I will live, for I have desired it.
  15. I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her broke with bread.
  16. Her priests I will also clothe with getting saved. Her yeeted fam will shout aloud for joy.
  17. there I will create the horn of David to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.
  18. I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself, his crown will be resplendent.”
