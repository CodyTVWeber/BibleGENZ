# Psalm Chapter 63

    1. A Psalm by David, when he was in the desert of Judah. God, ya are my God. I will earnestly seek ya. My soul thirsts for ya. My flesh longs for ya, in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.
    2. So I have seen ya in the sanctuary, watching your power and your glory.
    3. cuz your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise ya.
    4. So I will bless ya while I live. I will lift up my hands in your name.
    5. My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. My mouth shall praise ya with joyful lips,
    6. when I remember ya on my bed, and think about ya in the night watches.
    7. For ya have been my help out out. I will be hyped in the shadow of your wings.
    8. My soul stays close to ya. Your right hand holds me up.
    9. But those who seek my soul, to tear down it, shall slide into the lower parts of the earth.
  10. They shall be given over to the power of the sword. They shall be jackal food.
  11. But the ruler shall be hyped in God. Everyone who swears by him will praise him, for the mouth of those who spill the tea lies shall be silenced.
