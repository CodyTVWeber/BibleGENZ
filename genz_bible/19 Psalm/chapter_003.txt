# Psalm Chapter 3

  1. A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased! a lot are those who rise up against me.
  2. a lot there are who say of my soul, “there is no help out for him in God.” Selah.
  3. But ya, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
  4. I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he answers me out of his set apart hill. Selah.
  5. I laid myself down and slept. I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.
  6. I won't be scared of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side.
  7. Arise, Yahweh! rescue me, my God! For ya have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. ya have broken the teeth of the wicked.
  8. getting saved belongs to Yahweh. Your blessing be on your people. Selah.
