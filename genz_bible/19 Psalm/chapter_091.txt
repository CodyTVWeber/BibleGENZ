# Psalm Chapter 91

    1. He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
    2. I will say of Yahweh, “He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.”
    3. For he will deliver ya from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.
    4. He will cover ya with his feathers. Under his wings ya will grab refuge. His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.
    5. ya won't be scared of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day;
    6. nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.
    7. A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it won't come through through near ya.
    8. ya will only look with your eyes, and check it out the recompense of the wicked.
    9. cuz ya have made Yahweh your refuge, and the Most High your dwelling place,
  10. no evil shall happen to ya, neither shall any plague come through through near your dwelling.
  11. For he will put his angels in charge of ya, to guard ya in all your ways.
  12. They will bear ya up in their hands, so that ya won’t dash your foot against a stone.
  13. ya will tread on the lion and cobra. ya will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.
  14. “cuz he has set his show show love on me, so basically I will deliver him. I will set him on high, cuz he has known my name.
  15. He will call on me, and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him, and honor him.
  16. I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my getting saved.”
