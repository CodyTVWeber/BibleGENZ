# Psalm Chapter 42

    1. For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by the sons of Korah. As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants after ya, God.
    2. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come through through and appear before God?
    3. My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”
    4. These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I used to slide with the crowd, and led them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a yeeted day.
    5. Why are ya in despair, my soul? Why are ya disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him for the saving help out out of his presence.
    6. My God, my soul is in despair within me. so basically I remember ya from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar.
    7. Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. All your waves and your billows have swept over me.
    8. Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime. In the night his song shall be with me: a talking to God to the God of my life.
    9. I will ask God, my rock, “Why have ya forgotten me? Why do I slide mourning cuz of the oppression of the enemy?”
  10. As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, while they continually ask me, “Where is your God?”
  11. Why are ya in despair, my soul? Why are ya disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him, the saving help out out of my countenance, and my God.
