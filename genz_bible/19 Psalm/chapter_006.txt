# Psalm Chapter 6

  1. For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David. Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me in your wrath.
  2. Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.
  3. My soul is also in major anguish. But ya, Yahweh—how long?
  4. Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, and rescue me for your loving kindness’ sake.
  5. For in death there is no memory of ya. In Sheol, who shall hook it up ya thanks?
  6. I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears.
  7. My eye wastes away cuz of grief. It grows old cuz of all my adversaries.
  8. Depart from me, all ya workers of iniquity, for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.
  9. Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh accepts my talking to God.
 10. May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.
