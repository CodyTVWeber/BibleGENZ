# Psalm Chapter 65

    1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. A song. Praise waits for ya, God, in Zion. To ya shall vows be performed.
    2. ya who hear talking to God, to ya all men will come through through.
    3. Sins overwhelmed me, but ya atoned for our transgressions.
    4. blessed up up is one whom ya choose, and cause to come through through near, that he may live in your courts. We will be filled with the goodness of your house, your yeeted God's house.
    5. By awesome deeds of righteousness, ya answer us, God of our getting saved. ya who are the hope of all the ends of the earth, of those who are far away on the sea;
    6. Who by his power forms the mountains, having armed yourself with strength;
    7. who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.
    8. They also who dwell in faraway places are scared at your wonders. ya call the morningâ€™s dawn and the evening with songs of joy.
    9. ya visit the earth, and water it. ya greatly enrich it. The river of God is full of water. ya provide them grain, for so ya have ordained it.
  10. ya drench its furrows. ya level its ridges. ya soften it with showers. ya bless it with a crop.
  11. ya crown the year with your bounty. Your carts overflow with abundance.
  12. The wilderness grasslands overflow. The hills are clothed with gladness.
  13. The pastures are covered with flocks. The valleys also are clothed with grain. They shout for joy! They also sing.
