# Psalm Chapter 79

  1. A Psalm by Asaph. God, the nations have come through into your inheritance. They have defiled your set apart God's house. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
  2. They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your set apart fam to the animals of the earth.
  3. Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem. there was no one to bury them.
  4. We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.
  5. How long, Yahweh? Will ya be mad salty forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?
  6. Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t get it ya; on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name;
  7. For they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.
  8. Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.
  9. help out us, God of our getting saved, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.
 10. Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.
 11. Let the sighing of the prisoner come through before ya. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.
 12. Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached ya, boss.
 13. So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will hook it up ya thanks forever. We will praise ya forever, to all generations.
