  5. For ya, boss, are fire, and ready to forgive; abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on ya.
  6. Hear, Yahweh, my talking to God. listen up to the voice of my petitions.
  7. In the day of my trouble I will call on ya, for ya will answer me.
  8. there is no one like ya among the gods, boss, nor any deeds like your deeds.
  9. All nations ya have made will come through and giving props before ya, boss. They shall glorify your name.
 10. For ya are major, and do wondrous things. ya are God alone.
 11. drop knowledge me your way, Yahweh. I will walk in your truth. create my heart undivided to fear your name.
