# Psalm Chapter 149

  1. Praise Yahweh! Sing to Yahweh a new song, his praise in the assembly of the set apart fam.
  2. Let Israel be hyped in him who made them. Let the children of Zion be joyful in their ruler.
  3. Let them praise his name in the dance! Let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp!
  4. For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people. He crowns the humble with getting saved.
  5. Let the set apart fam be hyped in honor. Let them sing for joy on their beds.
  6. May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hand;
  7. To execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples;
  8. To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
  9. to execute on them the written judgment. All his set apart fam have this honor. Praise Yah!
