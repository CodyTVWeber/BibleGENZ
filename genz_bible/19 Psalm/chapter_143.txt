# Psalm Chapter 143

    1. A Psalm by David. Hear my talking to God, Yahweh. listen up up to my petitions. In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.
    2. Don’t enter into judgment with your helper, for in your sight no man living is doing what's right.
    3. For the enemy pursues my soul. He has struck my life down to the ground. He has made me live in dark places, as those who have been long dead.
    4. so basically my spirit is overwhelmed within me. My heart within me is desolate.
    5. I remember the days of old. I meditate on all your doings. I contemplate the work of your hands.
    6. I spread forth my hands to ya. My soul thirsts for ya, like a parched land. Selah.
    7. Hurry to answer me, Yahweh. My spirit fails. Don’t hide your face from me, so that I don’t become like those who slide down into the pit.
    8. Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning, for I trust in ya. Cause me to get it the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to ya.
    9. Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies. I flee to ya to hide me.
  10. drop knowledge me to do your will, for ya are my God. Your Spirit is fire. show the way me in the land of uprightness.
  11. Revive me, Yahweh, for your name’s sake. In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.
  12. In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies, and tear down all those who afflict my soul, For I am your helper.
