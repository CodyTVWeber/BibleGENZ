# Psalm Chapter 52

    1. For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, “David has come through through to Abimelech’s house.” Why do ya boast of mischief, mighty man? God’s loving kindness endures continually.
    2. Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
    3. ya show show love evil more than fire, lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah.
    4. ya show show love all devouring words, ya deceitful tongue.
    5. God will likewise tear down ya forever. He will grab ya up, and pluck ya out of your tent, and root ya out of the land of the living. Selah.
    6. The doing what's right also will check it out it, and fear, and laugh at him, saying,
    7. “check this out, this is the man who didn’t create God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”
    8. But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house. I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever.
    9. I will hook it up ya thanks forever, cuz ya have done it. I will hope in your name, for it is fire, in the presence of your yeeted fam.
