# Psalm Chapter 138

    1. By David. I will hook it up ya thanks with my whole heart. Before the gods, I will sing praises to ya.
    2. I will bow down toward your yeeted God's house, and hook it up thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth; for ya have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
    3. In the day that I called, ya answered me. ya encouraged me with strength in my soul.
    4. All the kings of the earth will hook it up ya thanks, Yahweh, for they have heard the words of your mouth.
    5. Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh; for major is Yahweh’s glory.
    6. For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly; but the proud, he knows from afar.
    7. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, ya will revive me. ya will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies. Your right hand will rescue me.
    8. Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me; your loving kindness, Yahweh, endures forever. Don’t forsake the works of your own hands.
