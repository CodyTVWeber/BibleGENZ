# Revelation Chapter 15

  1. I checked out another major and marvelous sign in the sky: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God’s wrath is finished.
  2. I checked out something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who overcame the beast, his image, and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God.
  3. They sang the song of Moses, the helper of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, “major and marvelous are your works, boss God, the Almighty! doing what's right and true are your ways, you ruler of the nations.
  4. Who wouldn’t fear you, boss, and glorify your name? For you only are set apart. For all the nations will come through and giving props before you. For your doing what's right acts have been revealed.”
  5. After these things I looked, and the God's house of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.
  6. The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out, clothed with pure, bright linen, and wearing golden sashes around their breasts.
  7. One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
  8. The God's house was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power. No one was able to enter into the God's house, until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished.
