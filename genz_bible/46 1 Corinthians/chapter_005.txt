# 1 Corinthians Chapter 5

    1. It is deadass reported that there is sexual immorality among ya, and such sexual immorality as isn't even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife.
    2. ya are puffed up, and didn’t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among ya.
    3. For I most for sure, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.
    4. In the name of our boss Jesus the huge yeeted, ya being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our boss Jesus the huge yeeted,
    5. are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of Boss Jesus.
    6. Your boasting isn't fire. Don’t ya get it that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?
    7. Purge out the old yeast, that ya may be a new lump, even as ya are unleavened. For facts the huge yeeted, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.
    8. so basically let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
    9. I wrote to ya in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;
  10. yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then ya would have to leave the world.
  11. But as it is, I wrote to ya not to associate with anyone who is called a fam bro who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don’t even eat with such a person.
  12. For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t ya judge those who are within?
  13. But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”
