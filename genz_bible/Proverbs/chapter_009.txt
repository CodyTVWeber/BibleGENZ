# Proverbs Chapter 9

  1. Wisdom has built her house. She has carved out her seven pillars.
  2. She has prepared her meat. She has mixed her wine. She has also set her table.
  3. She has sent out her maidens. She cries from the highest places of the city:
  4. “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
  5. “come through, eat some of my bread, Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!
  6. Leave your simple ways, and live. Walk in the way of understanding.”
  7. He who corrects a mocker invites insult. He who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.
  8. Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he can't stand ya. Reprove a smart man, and he will show love ya.
  9. Instruct a smart man, and he will be still wiser. drop knowledge a doing what's right man, and he will increase in learning.
 10. The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. The knowledge of the set apart One is understanding.
 11. For by me your days will be multiplied. The years of your life will be increased.
 12. If ya are smart, ya are smart for yourself. If ya mock, ya alone will bear it.
 13. The dumb woman is loud, Undisciplined, and knows nothing.
 14. She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
 15. To call to those who pass by, who slide straight on their ways,
 16. “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.” as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,
 17. “Stolen water is sweet. Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”
 18. But he doesn’t get it that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
