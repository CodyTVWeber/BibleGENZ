# Psalm Chapter 1

  1. blessed up is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
  2. but his delight is in Yahweh’s law. On his law he meditates day and night.
  3. He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.
  4. The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
  5. so basically the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the doing what's right.
  6. For Yahweh knows the way of the doing what's right, but the way of the wicked shall perish.
