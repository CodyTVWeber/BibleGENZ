# Psalm Chapter 20

  1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David. May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high,
  2. send you help out from the sanctuary, grant you support from Zion,
  3. remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt giving it up. Selah.
  4. May He grant you your heartâ€™s desire, and fulfill all your counsel.
  5. We will triumph in your getting saved. In the name of our God, we will set up our banners. May Yahweh grant all your requests.
  6. now I get it that Yahweh saves his anointed. He will answer him from his set apart heaven, with the saving strength of his right hand.
  7. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we trust the name of Yahweh our God.
  8. They are bowed down and fallen, but we rise up, and stand upright.
  9. rescue, Yahweh! Let the ruler answer us when we call!
