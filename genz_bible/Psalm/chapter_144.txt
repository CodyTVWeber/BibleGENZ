# Psalm Chapter 144

  1. By David. blessed up be Yahweh, my rock, who teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to battle:
  2. my loving kindness, my fortress, my high tower, my deliverer, my shield, and he in whom I grab refuge; who subdues my people under me.
  3. Yahweh, what is man, that ya care for him? Or the son of man, that ya think of him?
  4. Man is like a breath. His days are like a shadow that passes away.
  5. Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come through down. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.
  6. Throw out lightning, and scatter them. Send out your arrows, and rout them.
  7. Stretch out your hand from above, rescue me, and deliver me out of major waters, out of the hands of foreigners;
  8. whose mouths spill the tea deceit, Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
  9. I will sing a new song to ya, God. On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to ya.
 10. ya are he who gives getting saved to kings, who rescues David, his helper, from the deadly sword.
 11. Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners, whose mouths spill the tea deceit, whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
 12. then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
 13. Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision. Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields.
 14. Our oxen will pull heavy loads. there is no breaking in, and no going away, and no outcry in our streets.
 15. vibing are the people who are in such a situation. vibing are the people whose God is Yahweh.
