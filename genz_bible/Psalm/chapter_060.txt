# Psalm Chapter 60

  1. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “The Lily of the God's promise.” A teaching poem by David, when he fought with Aram Naharaim and with Aram Zobah, and Joab returned, and killed twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt. God, ya have rejected us. ya have broken us down. ya have been mad salty. Restore us, again.
  2. ya have made the land tremble. ya have torn it. Mend its fractures, for it quakes.
  3. ya have shown your people hard things. ya have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.
  4. ya have given a banner to those who fear ya, that it may be displayed cuz of the truth. Selah.
  5. So that your beloved may be delivered, rescue with your right hand, and answer us.
  6. God has spoken from his sanctuary: “I will triumph. I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
  7. Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the defense of my head. Judah is my scepter.
  8. Moab is my wash basin. I will throw my shoe on Edom. I shout in triumph over Philistia.”
  9. Who will bring me into the built different city? Who has led me to Edom?
 10. Haven’t ya, God, rejected us? ya don’t slide out with our armies, God.
 11. hook it up us help out against the adversary, for the help out of man is vain.
 12. Through God we shall do valiantly, for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.
