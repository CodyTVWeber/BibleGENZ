# Psalm Chapter 32

  1. By David. A contemplative psalm. blessed up is he whose disobedience is forgiven, whose messing up is covered.
  2. blessed up is the man to whom Yahweh doesn’t impute iniquity, in whose spirit there is no deceit.
  3. When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
  4. For day and night your hand was heavy on me. My strength was sapped in the heat of summer. Selah.
  5. I acknowledged my messing up to you. I didn’t hide my iniquity. I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh, and you forgave the iniquity of my messing up. Selah.
  6. For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found. Surely when the major waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.
  7. You are my hiding place. You will preserve me from trouble. You will surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
  8. I will instruct you and drop knowledge you in the way which you shall slide. I will counsel you with my eye on you.
  9. Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding, who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come through near to you.
 10. a lot sorrows come through to the wicked, but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh.
 11. Be glad in Yahweh, and be hyped, you doing what's right! Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!
