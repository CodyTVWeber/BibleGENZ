# Psalm Chapter 38

  1. A Psalm by David, for a memorial. Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your wrath, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.
  2. For your arrows have pierced me, your hand presses hard on me.
  3. there is no soundness in my flesh cuz of your indignation, neither is there any health in my bones cuz of my messing up.
  4. For my iniquities have gone over my head. As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
  5. My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, cuz of my foolishness.
  6. I am pained and bowed down greatly. I slide mourning all day long.
  7. For my waist is filled with burning. there is no soundness in my flesh.
  8. I am faint and severely bruised. I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.
  9. boss, all my desire is before ya. My groaning isn't hidden from ya.
 10. My heart throbs. My strength fails me. As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.
 11. My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague. My kinsmen stand far away.
 12. They also who seek after my life lay snares. Those who seek my hurt spill the tea mischievous things, and meditate deceits all day long.
 13. But I, as a deaf man, don’t hear. I am as a mute man who doesn’t open his mouth.
 14. Yes, I am as a man who doesn’t hear, in whose mouth are no reproofs.
 15. For in ya, Yahweh, do I hope. ya will answer, boss my God.
 16. For I said, “Don’t let them gloat over me, or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips.”
 17. For I am ready to fall. My pain is continually before me.
 18. For I will declare my iniquity. I will be sorry for my messing up.
 19. But my enemies are vigorous and a lot. Those who can't stand me without reason are numerous.
 20. They who also render evil for fire are adversaries to me, cuz I roll with what is fire.
 21. Don’t forsake me, Yahweh. My God, don’t be far from me.
 22. Hurry to help out me, boss, my getting saved.
