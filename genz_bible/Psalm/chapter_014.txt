# Psalm Chapter 14

  1. For the Chief Musician. By David. The fool has said in his heart, “there is no God.” They are corrupt. They have done abominable works. there is none who does fire.
  2. Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, to check it out if there were any who understood, who sought after God.
  3. They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt. there is none who does fire, no, not one.
  4. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don’t call on Yahweh?
  5. there they were in major fear, for God is in the generation of the doing what's right.
  6. ya frustrate the plan of the broke, cuz Yahweh is his refuge.
  7. Oh that the getting saved of Israel would come through out of Zion! When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people, then Jacob shall be hyped, and Israel shall be glad.
