# Psalm Chapter 110

  1. A Psalm by David. Yahweh says to my boss, “Sit at my right hand, until I create your enemies your footstool for your feet.”
  2. Yahweh will send forth the rod of your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of your enemies.
  3. Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power, in set apart array. Out of the womb of the morning, ya have the dew of your youth.
  4. Yahweh has sworn, and won't change his mind: “ya are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”
  5. the boss is at your right hand. He will crush kings in the day of his wrath.
  6. He will judge among the nations. He will heap up dead bodies. He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.
  7. He will drink of the brook in the way; so basically he will lift up his head.
