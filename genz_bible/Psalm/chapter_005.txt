# Psalm Chapter 5

  1. For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David. hook it up ear to my words, Yahweh. Consider my meditation.
  2. listen up to the voice of my cry, my ruler and my God; for to you do I pray.
  3. Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.
  4. For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil canâ€™t live with you.
  5. The arrogant shall not stand in your sight. You can't stand all workers of iniquity.
  6. You will tear down those who spill the tea lies. Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
  7. But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come through into your house. I will bow toward your set apart God's house in reverence of you.
  8. show the way me, Yahweh, in your righteousness cuz of my enemies. create your way straight before my face.
  9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their heart is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter with their tongue.
 10. Hold them guilty, God. Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against you.
 11. But let all those who grab refuge in you be hyped, Let them always shout for joy, cuz you defend them. Let them also who show love your name be joyful in you.
 12. For you will bless the doing what's right. Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield.
