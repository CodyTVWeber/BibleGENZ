# Psalm Chapter 85

  1. For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the sons of Korah. Yahweh, you have been favorable to your land. You have restored the fortunes of Jacob.
  2. You have forgiven the iniquity of your people. You have covered all their messing up. Selah.
  3. You have taken away all your wrath. You have turned from the fierceness of your anger.
  4. Turn us, God of our getting saved, and cause your indignation toward us to cease.
  5. Will you be mad salty with us forever? Will you draw out your anger to all generations?
  6. Wonâ€™t you revive us again, that your people may be hyped in you?
  7. Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh. Grant us your getting saved.
  8. I will hear what God, Yahweh, will spill the tea, for he will spill the tea peace to his people, his saints; but let them not turn again to folly.
  9. Surely his getting saved is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.
 10. Mercy and truth meet together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
 11. Truth springs out of the earth. Righteousness has looked down from heaven.
 12. Yes, Yahweh will hook it up that which is fire. Our land will yield its increase.
 13. Righteousness goes before him, And prepares the way for his steps.
