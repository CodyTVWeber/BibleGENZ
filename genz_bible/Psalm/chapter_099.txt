# Psalm Chapter 99

  1. Yahweh reigns! Let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned among the cherubim. Let the earth be moved.
  2. Yahweh is major in Zion. He is high above all the peoples.
  3. Let them praise your major and awesome name. He is set apart!
  4. The rulerâ€™s strength also loves justice. ya do establish equity. ya execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.
  5. Exalt Yahweh our God. giving props at his footstool. He is set apart!
  6. Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel among those who call on his name; they called on Yahweh, and he answered them.
  7. He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies, the statute that he gave them.
  8. ya answered them, Yahweh our God. ya are a God who forgave them, although ya took vengeance for their doings.
  9. Exalt Yahweh, our God. giving props at his set apart hill, for Yahweh, our God, is set apart!
