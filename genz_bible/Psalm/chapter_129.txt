# Psalm Chapter 129

  1. A Song of Ascents. a lot times they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel now say,
  2. a lot times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me.
  3. The plowers plowed on my back. They made their furrows long.
  4. Yahweh is doing what's right. He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
  5. Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those who can't stand Zion.
  6. Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up;
  7. with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.
  8. Neither do those who slide by say, “The blessing of Yahweh be on you. We bless you in the name of Yahweh.”
