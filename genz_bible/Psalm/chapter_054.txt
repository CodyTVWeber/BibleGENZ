  1. For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A contemplation by David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, “Isn’t David hiding himself among us?” rescue me, God, by your name. Vindicate me in your might.
  2. Hear my talking to God, God. listen up to the words of my mouth.
  3. For strangers have risen up against me. Violent men have sought after my soul. They haven’t set God before them. Selah.
  4. check this out, God is my helper. The boss is the one who sustains my soul.
  5. He will repay the evil to my enemies. tear down them in your truth.
  6. With a free will giving to God, I will giving it up to you. I will hook it up thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is fire.
  7. For he has delivered me out of all trouble. My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.
