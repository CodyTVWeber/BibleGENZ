# Psalm Chapter 39

  1. For the Chief Musician. For Jeduthun. A Psalm by David. I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t messing up with my tongue. I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.”
  2. I was mute with silence. I held my peace, even from fire. My feeling down was stirred.
  3. My heart was hot within me. While I meditated, the fire burned: I spoke with my tongue:
  4. “Yahweh, show me my end, what is the measure of my days. Let me get it how frail I am.
  5. check this out,, ya have made my days handbreadths. My lifetime is as nothing before ya. Surely every man stands as a breath.” Selah.
  6. “Surely every man walks like a shadow. Surely they busy themselves in vain. He heaps up, and doesn’t get it who shall gather.
  7. now, boss, what do I wait for? My hope is in ya.
  8. Deliver me from all my transgressions. Don’t create me the reproach of the dumb.
  9. I was mute. I didn’t open my mouth, cuz ya did it.
 10. Remove your scourge away from me. I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
 11. When ya rebuke and correct man for iniquity, ya consume his wealth like a moth. Surely every man is but a breath.” Selah.
 12. “Hear my talking to God, Yahweh, and hook it up ear to my cry. Don’t be silent at my tears. For I am a stranger with ya, a foreigner, as all my fathers were.
 13. Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, before I slide away, and exist no more.”
