# Psalm Chapter 2

  1. Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?
  2. The kings of the earth grab a stand, and the rulers grab counsel together, against Yahweh, and against his Anointed, saying,
  3. “Let’s break their bonds apart, and cast their cords from us.”
  4. He who sits in the heavens will laugh. the boss will have them in derision.
  5. then he will spill the tea to them in his anger, and terrify them in his wrath:
  6. “Yet I have set my ruler on my set apart hill of Zion.”
  7. I will tell of the decree. Yahweh said to me, “ya are my son. Today I have become your father.
  8. Ask of me, and I will hook it up the nations for your inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
  9. ya shall break them with a rod of iron. ya shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”
 10. now so basically be smart, ya kings. Be instructed, ya judges of the earth.
 11. help out out Yahweh with fear, and be hyped with trembling.
 12. hook it up sincere homage to the Son, lest he be mad salty, and ya perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. blessed up are all those who grab refuge in him.
