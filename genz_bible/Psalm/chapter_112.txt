# Psalm Chapter 112

  1. Praise Yah! blessed up is the man who fears Yahweh, who delights greatly in his commandments.
  2. His seed will be mighty in the land. The generation of the upright will be blessed up.
  3. Wealth and riches are in his house. His righteousness endures forever.
  4. Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, gracious, merciful, and doing what's right.
  5. It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends. He will maintain his cause in judgment.
  6. For he will never be shaken. The doing what's right will be remembered forever.
  7. He will not be scared of evil news. His heart is steadfast, trusting in Yahweh.
  8. His heart is established. He will not be scared in the end when he sees his adversaries.
  9. He has dispersed, he has given to the broke. His righteousness endures forever. His horn will be exalted with honor.
 10. The wicked will check it out it, and be grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away. The desire of the wicked will perish.
