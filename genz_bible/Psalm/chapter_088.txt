# Psalm Chapter 88

  1. A Song. A Psalm by the sons of Korah. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “The Suffering of Affliction.” A contemplation by Heman, the Ezrahite. Yahweh, the God of my getting saved, I have cried day and night before ya.
  2. Let my talking to God enter into your presence. Turn your ear to my cry.
  3. For my soul is full of troubles. My life draws near to Sheol.
  4. I am counted among those who slide down into the pit. I am like a man who has no help out,
  5. yeeted among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom ya remember no more. They are cut off from your hand.
  6. ya have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.
  7. Your wrath lies heavily on me. ya have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah.
  8. ya have taken my friends from me. ya have made me an abomination to them. I am confined, and I can’t escape.
  9. My eyes are dim from grief. I have called on ya daily, Yahweh. I have spread out my hands to ya.
 10. Do ya show wonders to the dead? Do the dead rise up and praise ya? Selah.
 11. Is your loving kindness declared in the grave? Or your faithfulness in Destruction?
 12. Are your wonders made known in the dark? Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
 13. But to ya, Yahweh, I have cried. In the morning, my talking to God comes before ya.
 14. Yahweh, why do ya reject my soul? Why do ya hide your face from me?
 15. I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.
 16. Your fierce wrath has gone over me. Your terrors have cut me off.
 17. They came around me like water all day long. They completely engulfed me.
 18. ya have put lover and friend far from me, and my friends into darkness.
