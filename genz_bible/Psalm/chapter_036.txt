# Psalm Chapter 36

  1. For the Chief Musician. By David, the helper of Yahweh. An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked: “there is no fear of God before his eyes.”
  2. For he flatters himself in his own eyes, too much to detect and can't stand his messing up.
  3. The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit. He has ceased to be smart and to do fire.
  4. He plots iniquity on his bed. He sets himself in a way that is not fire. He doesn’t abhor evil.
  5. Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
  6. Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. Your judgments are like a major deep. Yahweh, you preserve man and animal.
  7. How precious is your loving kindness, God! The children of men grab refuge under the shadow of your wings.
  8. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house. You will create them drink of the river of your pleasures.
  9. For with you is the spring of life. In your light shall we check it out light.
 10. Oh continue your loving kindness to those who get it you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.
 11. Don’t let the foot of pride come through against me. Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.
 12. there the workers of iniquity are fallen. They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
