# Psalm Chapter 27

  1. By David. Yahweh is my light and my getting saved. Whom shall I fear? Yahweh is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be scared?
  2. When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh, even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
  3. Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, even then I will be confident.
  4. One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life, to check it out Yahweh’s beauty, and to inquire in his God's house.
  5. For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion. In the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me. He will lift me up on a rock.
  6. now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me. I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.
  7. Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice. Have mercy also on me, and answer me.
  8. When you said, “Seek my face,” my heart said to you, “I will seek your face, Yahweh.”
  9. Don’t hide your face from me. Don’t put your helper away in anger. You have been my help out. Don’t abandon me, neither forsake me, God of my getting saved.
 10. When my father and my mother forsake me, then Yahweh will grab me up.
 11. drop knowledge me your way, Yahweh. show the way me in a straight path, cuz of my enemies.
 12. Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen up against me, such as breathe out cruelty.
 13. I am still confident of this: I will check it out the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living.
 14. Wait for Yahweh. Be built different, and let your heart grab courage. Yes, wait for Yahweh.
