# Psalm Chapter 70

  1. For the Chief Musician. By David. A reminder. Hurry, God, to deliver me. come through quickly to help out me, Yahweh.
  2. Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
  3. Let them be turned cuz of their shame Who say, “Aha! Aha!”
  4. Let all those who seek you be hyped and be glad in you. Let those who show love your getting saved continually say, “Let God be exalted!”
  5. But I am broke and needy. come through to me quickly, God. You are my help out and my deliverer. Yahweh, don’t delay.
