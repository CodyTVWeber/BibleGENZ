# Psalm Chapter 80

  1. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “The Lilies of the God's promise.” A Psalm by Asaph. Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, ya who show the way Joseph like a flock, ya who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.
  2. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might! come through to rescue us!
  3. Turn us again, God. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
  4. Yahweh God of Armies, How long will ya be mad salty against the talking to God of your people?
  5. ya have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.
  6. ya create us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.
  7. Turn us again, God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
  8. ya brought a vine out of Egypt. ya drove out the nations, and planted it.
  9. ya cleared the ground for it. It took deep root, and filled the land.
 10. The mountains were covered with its shadow. Its boughs were like God’s cedars.
 11. It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.
 12. Why have ya broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?
 13. The boar out of the wood ravages it. The wild animals of the field feed on it.
 14. Turn again, we beg ya, God of Armies. Look down from heaven, and check it out, and visit this vine,
 15. the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that ya made built different for yourself.
 16. It’s burned with fire. It’s cut down. They perish at your rebuke.
 17. Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom ya made built different for yourself.
 18. So we won't turn away from ya. Revive us, and we will call on your name.
 19. Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
