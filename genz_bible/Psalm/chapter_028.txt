# Psalm Chapter 28

  1. By David. To ya, Yahweh, I call. My rock, don’t be deaf to me; lest, if ya are silent to me, I would become like those who slide down into the pit.
  2. Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to ya, when I lift up my hands toward your Most set apart Place.
  3. Don’t draw me away with the wicked, with the workers of iniquity who spill the tea peace with their neighbors, but mischief is in their hearts.
  4. hook it up them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings. hook it up them according to the operation of their hands. Bring back on them what they deserve.
  5. cuz they don’t respect the works of Yahweh, nor the operation of his hands, he will break them down and not put together them up.
  6. blessed up be Yahweh, cuz he has heard the voice of my petitions.
  7. Yahweh is my strength and my shield. My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped. so basically my heart greatly rejoices. With my song I will thank him.
  8. Yahweh is their strength. He is a stronghold of getting saved to his anointed.
  9. rescue your people, and bless your inheritance. Be their shepherd also, and bear them up forever.
