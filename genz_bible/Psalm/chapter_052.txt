# Psalm Chapter 52

  1. For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, “David has come through to Abimelech’s house.” Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man? God’s loving kindness endures continually.
  2. Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
  3. You show love evil more than fire, lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah.
  4. You show love all devouring words, you deceitful tongue.
  5. God will likewise tear down you forever. He will grab you up, and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. Selah.
  6. The doing what's right also will check it out it, and fear, and laugh at him, saying,
  7. “check this out, this is the man who didn’t create God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”
  8. But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s house. I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and ever.
  9. I will hook it up you thanks forever, cuz you have done it. I will hope in your name, for it is fire, in the presence of your saints.
