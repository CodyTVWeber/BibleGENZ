# Psalm Chapter 82

  1. A Psalm by Asaph. God presides in the major assembly. He judges among the gods.
  2. “How long will ya judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked?” Selah.
  3. “Defend the not it, the broke, and the fatherless. Maintain the rights of the broke and oppressed.
  4. Rescue the not it and needy. Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”
  5. They don’t get it, neither do they understand. They walk back and forth in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
  6. I said, “ya are gods, all of ya are sons of the Most High.
  7. Nevertheless ya shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.”
  8. Arise, God, judge the earth, for ya inherit all of the nations.
