# Psalm Chapter 43

  1. Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.
  2. For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me? Why do I slide mourning cuz of the oppression of the enemy?
  3. Oh, send out your light and your truth. Let them show the way me. Let them bring me to your set apart hill, To your tents.
  4. then I will slide to the prayer spot of God, to God, my exceeding joy. I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.
  5. Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise him: my Savior, my helper, and my God.
