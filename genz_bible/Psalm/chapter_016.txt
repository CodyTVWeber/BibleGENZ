# Psalm Chapter 16

  1. A Poem by David. Preserve me, God, for in ya do I grab refuge.
  2. My soul, ya have said to Yahweh, “ya are my boss. Apart from ya I have no fire thing.”
  3. As for the set apart fam who are in the earth, they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.
  4. Their sorrows shall be multiplied who hook it up gifts to another God. Their drink offerings of blood I won't offer, nor grab their names on my lips.
  5. Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup. ya made my lot secure.
  6. The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a fire inheritance.
  7. I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel. Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.
  8. I have set Yahweh always before me. cuz he is at my right hand, I won't be moved.
  9. so basically my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety.
 10. For ya won't leave my soul in Sheol, neither will ya allow your set apart one to check it out corruption.
 11. ya will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forevermore.
