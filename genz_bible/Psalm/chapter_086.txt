# Psalm Chapter 86

  1. A talking to God by David. Hear, Yahweh, and answer me, for I am broke and needy.
  2. Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You, my God, rescue your helper who trusts in you.
  3. Be merciful to me, boss, for I call to you all day long.
  4. Bring joy to the soul of your helper, for to you, boss, do I lift up my soul.
  5. For you, boss, are fire, and ready to forgive; abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you.
  6. Hear, Yahweh, my talking to God. listen up to the voice of my petitions.
  7. In the day of my trouble I will call on you, for you will answer me.
  8. there is no one like you among the gods, boss, nor any deeds like your deeds.
  9. All nations you have made will come through and giving props before you, boss. They shall glorify your name.
 10. For you are major, and do wondrous things. You are God alone.
 11. drop knowledge me your way, Yahweh. I will walk in your truth. create my heart undivided to fear your name.
 12. I will praise you, boss my God, with my whole heart. I will glorify your name forevermore.
 13. For your loving kindness is major toward me. You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
 14. God, the proud have risen up against me. A company of violent men have sought after my soul, and they donâ€™t hold regard for you before them.
 15. But you, boss, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth.
 16. Turn to me, and have mercy on me! hook it up your strength to your helper. rescue the son of your handmaid.
 17. Show me a sign of your goodness, that those who can't stand me may check it out it, and be shamed, cuz you, Yahweh, have helped me, and comforted me.
