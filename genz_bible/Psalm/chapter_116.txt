# Psalm Chapter 116

  1. I show love Yahweh, cuz he listens to my voice, and my cries for mercy.
  2. cuz he has turned his ear to me, so basically I will call on him as long as I live.
  3. The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol got a hold of me. I found trouble and feeling down.
  4. then I called on the name of Yahweh: “Yahweh, I beg you, deliver my soul.”
  5. Yahweh is Gracious and doing what's right. Yes, our God is merciful.
  6. Yahweh preserves the simple. I was brought low, and he saved me.
  7. Return to your rest, my soul, for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.
  8. For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
  9. I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.
 10. I believed, so basically I said, “I was greatly afflicted.”
 11. I said in my haste, “All men are liars.”
 12. What will I hook it up to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me?
 13. I will grab the cup of getting saved, and call on the name of Yahweh.
 14. I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of all his people.
 15. Precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his saints.
 16. Yahweh, deadass I am your helper. I am your helper, the son of your handmaid. You have freed me from my chains.
 17. I will offer to you the giving it up of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of Yahweh.
 18. I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of all his people,
 19. in the courts of Yahweh’s house, in the midst of you, Jerusalem. Praise Yah!
