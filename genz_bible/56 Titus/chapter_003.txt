# Titus Chapter 3

  1. Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every fire work,
  2. to spill the tea evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be nice-nice, showing all humility toward all men.
  3. For we were also once dumb, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
  4. But when the kindness of God our Savior and his show love toward mankind appeared,
  5. not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the set apart Spirit,
  6. whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus the huge set apart our Savior;
  7. that, being justified by his God's show love, we might be made heirs according to the hope of living forever.
  8. This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that ya affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain fire works. These things are fire and profitable to men;
  9. but shun dumb questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
 10. Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;
 11. knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
 12. When I send Artemas to ya, or Tychicus, be diligent to come through to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.
 13. Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.
 14. Let our people also pick up to maintain fire works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
 15. All who are with me greet ya. Greet those who show love us in trusting the process. God's show love be with ya all. facts.
