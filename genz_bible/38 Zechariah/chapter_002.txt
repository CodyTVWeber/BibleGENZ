    2. then I asked, “Where are ya going?” He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to check it out what is its breadth and what is its length.”
    3. check this out, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
    4. and said to him, “Run, spill the tea to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, cuz of the multitude of men and livestock in it.
    5. For I,’ says Yahweh, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
    6. come through through! come through through! Flee from the land of the north,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I have spread ya abroad as the four winds of the sky,’ says Yahweh.
