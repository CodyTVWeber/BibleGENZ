# Zechariah Chapter 3

  1. He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.
  2. Yahweh said to Satan, “Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?”
  3. now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.
  4. He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “grab the filthy garments off of him.” To him he said, “check this out, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with stacked clothing.”
  5. I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.” So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and the angel of Yahweh was standing by.
  6. The angel of Yahweh protested to Joshua, saying,
  7. “Thus says Yahweh of Armies: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will roll with my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will hook it up you a place of access among these who stand by.
  8. Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, check this out, I will bring forth my helper, the Branch.
  9. For, check this out, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: check this out, I will engrave its engraving,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
 10. In that day,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.’”
