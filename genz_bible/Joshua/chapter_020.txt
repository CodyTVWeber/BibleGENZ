  2. “spill the tea to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Assign the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to ya by Moses,
  3. that the manslayer who kills any person accidentally or unintentionally may flee there. They shall be to ya for a refuge from the avenger of blood.
  4. He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city. They shall grab him into the city with them, and hook it up him a place, that he may live among them.
  5. If the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they won't deliver up the manslayer into his hand; cuz he struck his neighbor unintentionally, and didn’t can't stand him before.
  6. He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days. then the manslayer shall return, and come through to his own city, and to his own house, to the city he fled from.’”
  7. They yeeted Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
  8. Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
  9. These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the alien who lives among them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stands before the congregation.
