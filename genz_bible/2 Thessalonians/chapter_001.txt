# 2 Thessalonians Chapter 1

  1. Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the boss Jesus anointed one:
  2. God's show love to you and peace from God our Father and the boss Jesus anointed one.
  3. We are bound to always hook it up thanks to God for you, brothers, even as it is appropriate, cuz your trusting the process grows exceedingly, and the show love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds;
  4. so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and trusting the process in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you endure.
  5. This is an obvious sign of the doing what's right judgment of God, to the end that you may be counted worthy of the God's squad of God, for which you also suffer.
  6. Since it is a doing what's right thing with God to repay affliction to those who afflict you,
  7. and to hook it up relief to you who are afflicted with us, when the boss Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
  8. giving vengeance to those who don’t get it God, and to those who don’t obey the fire News of our boss Jesus,
  9. who will pay the penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the boss and from the glory of his might,
 10. when he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired among all those who have believed (cuz our testimony to you was believed) in that day.
 11. To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of trusting the process, with power;
 12. that the name of our boss Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the God's show love of our God and the boss Jesus anointed one.
