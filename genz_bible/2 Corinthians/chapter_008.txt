# 2 Corinthians Chapter 8

  1. Moreover, brothers, we create known to you the God's show love of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;
  2. how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.
  3. For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,
  4. begging us with much entreaty to receive this God's show love and the fellowship in the service to the saints.
  5. This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the boss, and to us through the will of God.
  6. So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this God's show love.
  7. But as you abound in everything, in trusting the process, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your show love to us, check it out that you also abound in this God's show love.
  8. I spill the tea not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your show love.
  9. For you get it the God's show love of our boss Jesus anointed one, that, though he was stacked, yet for your sakes he became broke, that you through his poverty might become stacked.
 10. I hook it up a judgment in this: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing.
 11. But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.
 12. For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you don’t have.
 13. For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,
 14. but for equality. Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality.
 15. As it is written, “He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.”
 16. But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
 17. For he facts accepted our exhortation, but being himself hella earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.
 18. We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the fire News is known through all the assemblies.
 19. Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this God's show love, which is served by us to the glory of the boss himself, and to show our readiness.
 20. We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us.
 21. Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the boss, but also in the sight of men.
 22. We have sent with them our brother, whom we have a lot times proved earnest in a lot things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the major confidence which he has in you.
 23. As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of anointed one.
 24. so basically show the proof of your show love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.
