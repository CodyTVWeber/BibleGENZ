# 3 John Chapter 1

    1. The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I show show love in truth.
    2. Beloved, I pray that ya may prosper in all things and be healthy, even as your soul prospers.
    3. For I rejoiced greatly, when brothers came and testified about your truth, even as ya walk in truth.
    4. I have no greater joy than this, to hear about my children walking in truth.
    5. Beloved, ya do a faithful work in whatever ya accomplish for those who are brothers and strangers.
    6. They have testified about your show show love before the assembly. ya will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way worthy of God,
    7. cuz for the sake of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
    8. We so basically ought to receive such, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.
    9. I wrote to the assembly, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, doesn’t accept what we say.
  10. so basically, if I come through through, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words. Not content with this, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those who would, he forbids and throws out of the assembly.
  11. Beloved, don’t imitate that which is evil, but that which is fire. He who does fire is of God. He who does evil hasn’t seen God.
  12. Demetrius has the testimony of all, and of the truth itself; yes, we also testify, and ya get it that our testimony is true.
  13. I had a lot things to write to ya, but I am unwilling to write to ya with ink and pen;
  14. but I hope to check it out ya soon, and we will spill the tea face to face. Peace be to ya. The friends greet ya. Greet the friends by name.
