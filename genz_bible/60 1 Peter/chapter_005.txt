# 1 Peter Chapter 5

  1. I exhort the elders among ya, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of the huge set apart, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.
  2. Shepherd the flock of God which is among ya, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly;
  3. neither as lording it over those entrusted to ya, but making yourselves examples to the flock.
  4. When the chief Shepherd is revealed, ya will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t fade away.
  5. Likewise, ya younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of ya clothe yourselves with humility, to subject yourselves to one another; for “God resists the proud, but gives God's show love to the humble.”
  6. Humble yourselves so basically under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt ya in due time;
  7. casting all your worries on him, cuz he cares for ya.
  8. Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
  9. Withstand him steadfast in your trusting the process, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.
 10. But may the God of all God's show love, who called ya to his eternal glory by the huge set apart Jesus, after ya have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle ya.
 11. To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. facts.
 12. Through Silvanus, our faithful fam bro, as I consider him, I have written to ya briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true God's show love of God in which ya stand.
 13. She who is in Babylon, chosen together with ya, greets ya; and so does Mark, my son.
 14. Greet one another with a kiss of show love. Peace be to ya all who are in the huge set apart Jesus. facts.
