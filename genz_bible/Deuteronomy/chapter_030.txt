# Deuteronomy Chapter 30

  1. It shall happen, when all these things have come through on ya, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before ya, and ya shall call them to mind among all the nations, where Yahweh your God has driven ya,
  2. and shall return to Yahweh your God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command ya this day, ya and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;
  3. that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on ya, and will return and gather ya from all the peoples, where Yahweh your God has scattered ya.
  4. If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there will Yahweh your God gather ya, and from there he will bring ya back:
  5. and Yahweh your God will bring ya into the land which your fathers possessed, and ya shall possess it; and he will do ya fire, and multiply ya above your fathers.
  6. Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to show love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that ya may live.
  7. Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies, and on those who can't stand ya, who persecuted ya.
  8. ya shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his commandments which I command ya this day.
  9. Yahweh your God will create ya plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for fire: for Yahweh will again be hyped over ya for fire, as he rejoiced over your fathers;
 10. if ya shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if ya turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.
 11. For this commandment which I command ya this day, it isn't too hard for ya, neither is it far off.
 12. It isn't in heaven, that ya should say, “Who shall slide up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and create us to hear it, that we may do it?”
 13. Neither is it beyond the sea, that ya should say, “Who shall slide over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and create us to hear it, that we may do it?”
 14. But the word is hella near to ya, in your mouth, and in your heart, that ya may do it.
 15. check this out,, I have set before ya this day life and fire, and death and evil;
 16. in that I command ya this day to show love Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that ya may live and multiply, and that Yahweh your God may bless ya in the land where ya slide in to possess it.
 17. But if your heart turns away, and ya won't hear, but shall be drawn away, and giving props other gods, and help out out them;
 18. I denounce to ya this day, that ya shall surely perish; ya won't prolong your days in the land, where ya pass over the Jordan to slide in to possess it.
 19. I call heaven and earth to witness against ya this day, that I have set before ya life and death, the blessing and the curse: so basically choose life, that ya may live, ya and your seed;
 20. to show love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days; that ya may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to hook it up them.
