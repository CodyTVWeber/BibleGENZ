# Jude Chapter 1

    1. Jude, a helper of Jesus huge set apart, and James’s fam bro, to the called fam — yeeted by God the Father and kept on lock for Jesus huge set apart.
    2. huge mercy, chill, and huge show love to ya — multiplied, fr fr.
    3. show love-show love one, I was highkey finna write about the getting saved we all share, but I had to pivot and urge ya to create the huge drop for the trusting the process — the once‑for‑all drop to set apart fam. No cap.
    4. Some sneaky ones slid in lowkey — receipts been out — trash ones twisting God’s show show love into messy wilding, and denying our one true Boss — God — and our Boss, Jesus huge set apart. huge sus.
    5. Quick reminder: Boss saved a whole people outta Egypt, then later clapped the ones who didn’t believe. Facts.
    6. Angels who didn’t stay in their lane but dipped their own spot — He’s got them on eternal lockdown in deep dark till the major Judgment Day. Deadass.
    7. Same energy as Sodom and Gomorrah (and nearby cities): went full‑send into sexual immorality and chased strange flesh; now they’re an example, catching that eternal‑fire L. Hits different.
    8. Same way, these dreamers defile their bodies, disrespect authority, and talk reckless about heavenly beings.
    9. But Michael the archangel, beefing with the devil over Moses’s body, didn’t slide off; he said, “May Boss rebuke ya.” That’s the move.
  10. They spill the tea loud on what they don’t get; the little they do by instinct — unthinking‑animal energy — wrecks them. huge yikes.
  11. Woe to them: walked like Cain, sprinted into Balaam’s bag‑chasing error, and got wrecked like Korah’s rebellion. Wrong squad.
  12. Hidden reefs at your show love‑feasts — eating with ya without fear — shepherds feeding themselves; rainless clouds blown around; autumn trees with zero fruit — double dead — yanked up by the roots. Trash vibes.
  13. Wild sea waves foaming up their own shame; wandering stars headed for deep black darkness forever.
  14. Enoch, seventh from Adam, called it: “Check this out — Boss pulled up with tens of thousands of his yeeted ones,
  15. to judge everyone and expose every deed the trash ones did in trash‑ones ways, and every hard word the trash ones talked against Him.” Receipts.
  16. Serial complainers, heavy mutterers — walking after cravings; loud mouths flexing; playing favorites for gain. Clout‑chasey.
  17. But ya, show love-show love ones, remember what Jesus broskies of our Boss Jesus huge set apart told ya:
  18. “In the last times, huge meanies will show up, living on their own trash‑ones cravings.” We’re seeing it.
  19. They split the squad and run on vibes — not Spirit. huge sus.
  20. But ya, show love-show love ones, keep building yourselves up on your most yeeted trusting the process; pray in the yeeted Spirit — fr.
  21. Stay locked in God’s show love, looking for huge mercy from our Boss Jesus huge set apart into forever‑life.
  22. Show huge mercy to the ones wavering — be nice-nice but real.
  23. Snatch others like from a fire — with fear — hating even the clothes stained by that mess. Don’t play with it.
  24. now to the One who can keep ya from tripping and present ya spotless in blazing shine with major joy —
  25. to God our Savior, max smart — glory, majesty, reign, and power levels, now and forever. Facts, no cap.
