# Genesis Chapter 34

    1. Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to check it out the daughters of the land.
    2. Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.
    3. His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.
    4. Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.”
    5. now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came.
    6. Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.
    7. The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were hella mad salty, cuz he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; a which thing ought not to be done.
    8. Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please hook it up her to him as a wife.
    9. create marriages with us. hook it up your daughters to us, and grab our daughters for yourselves.
  10. ya shall dwell with us, and the land will be before ya. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.”
  11. Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever ya will tell me I will hook it up.
  12. Ask me a major amount for a dowry, and I will hook it up whatever ya ask of me, but hook it up me the young lady as a wife.”
  13. The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, cuz he had defiled Dinah their sister,
  14. and said to them, “We can’t do this thing, to hook it up our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.
  15. Only on this condition will we consent to ya. If ya will be as we are, that every male of ya be circumcised;
  16. then will we hook it up our daughters to ya, and we will grab your daughters to us, and we will dwell with ya, and we will become one people.
  17. But if ya won't listen up up to us, to be circumcised, then we will grab our sister, and we will be gone.”
  18. Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son.
  19. The young man didn’t wait to do this thing, cuz he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was honored above all the house of his father.
  20. Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,
  21. “These men are peaceful with us. so basically let them live in the land and trade in it. For check this out, the land is large enough for them. Let us grab their daughters to us for wives, and let us hook it up them our daughters.
  22. Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.
  23. Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us hook it up our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.”
  24. All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
  25. It happened on the third day, when they were sore, that two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males.
  26. They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.
  27. Jacob’s sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, cuz they had defiled their sister.
  28. They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,
  29. and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was in the house.
  30. Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “ya have troubled me, to create me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am not much in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house.”
  31. They said, “Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?”
