# 2 John Chapter 1

  1. The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I show love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who get it the truth;
  2. for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:
  3. God's show love, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the boss Jesus anointed one, the Son of the Father, in truth and show love.
  4. I be hyped greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.
  5. now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we show love one another.
  6. This is show love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
  7. For a lot deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus anointed one came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.
  8. Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.
  9. Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of anointed one, doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.
 10. If anyone comes to you, and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,
 11. for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.
 12. Having a lot things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come through to you, and to spill the tea face to face, that our joy may be made full.
 13. The children of your chosen sister greet you. facts.
