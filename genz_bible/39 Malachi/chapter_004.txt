# Malachi Chapter 4

  1. “For, check this out,, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all who work wickedness, will be stubble; and the day that comes will burn them up,” says Yahweh of Armies, “that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
  2. But to ya who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings. ya will slide out, and leap like calves of the stall.
  3. ya shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I create,” says Yahweh of Armies.
  4. “Remember the law of Moses my helper, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.
  5. check this out,, I will send ya Elijah the God's messenger before the major and terrible day of Yahweh comes.
  6. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come through and strike the earth with a curse.”
