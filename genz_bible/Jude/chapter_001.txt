# Jude Chapter 1

  1. Jude, a servant of Jesus big Holy, and James’s fam bro, to the called fam — yeeted by God the Father and kept on lock for Jesus big Holy.
  2. Big mercy, chill, and big love to ya — multiplied, fr fr.
  3. Love-love one, I was highkey finna write about the salvation we all share, but I had to pivot and urge ya to make the big drop for the faith — the once‑for‑all drop to holy fam. No cap.
  4. Some sneaky ones slid in lowkey — receipts been out — bad ones twisting God’s show love into messy wilding, and denying our one true Boss — God — and our Boss, Jesus big Holy. Sus.
  5. Quick reminder: Boss saved a whole people outta Egypt, then later clapped the ones who didn’t believe. Facts.
  6. Angels who didn’t stay in their lane but dipped their own spot — He’s got them on eternal lockdown in deep dark till the major Judgment Day. Deadass.
  7. Same energy as Sodom and Gomorrah (and nearby cities): went full‑send into sexual immorality and chased strange flesh; now they’re an example, catching that eternal‑fire L. Hits different.
  8. Same way, these dreamers defile their bodies, disrespect authority, and talk reckless about heavenly beings.
  9. But Michael the archangel, beefing with the devil over Moses’s body, didn’t go off; he said, “May Boss rebuke you.” That’s the move.
 10. They speak loud on what they don’t get; the little they do by instinct — unthinking‑animal energy — wrecks them. Big yikes.
 11. Woe to them: walked like Cain, sprinted into Balaam’s bag‑chasing error, and got wrecked like Korah’s rebellion. Wrong squad.
 12. Hidden reefs at your love‑feasts — eating with ya without fear — shepherds feeding themselves; rainless clouds blown around; autumn trees with zero fruit — double dead — yanked up by the roots. Trash vibes.
 13. Wild sea waves foaming up their own shame; wandering stars headed for deep black darkness forever.
 14. Enoch, seventh from Adam, called it: “Check this out — Boss pulled up with tens of thousands of his yeeted ones,
 15. to judge everyone and expose every deed the bad ones did in bad‑ones ways, and every hard word the bad ones talked against Him.” Receipts.
 16. Serial complainers, heavy mutterers — walking after cravings; loud mouths flexing; playing favorites for gain. Clout‑chasey.
 17. But ya, love-love ones, remember what Jesus broskies of our Boss Jesus big Holy told ya:
 18. “In the last times, Big meanies will show up, living on their own bad‑ones cravings.” We’re seeing it.
 19. They split the squad and run on vibes — not Spirit. Big sus.
 20. But ya, love-love ones, keep building yourselves up on your most yeeted trusting the process; pray in the yeeted Spirit — fr.
 21. Stay locked in God’s love, looking for big mercy from our Boss Jesus big Holy into forever‑life.
 22. Show big mercy to the ones wavering — be nice-nice but real.
 23. Snatch others like from a fire — with fear — hating even the clothes stained by that mess. Don’t play with it.
 24. Now to the One who can keep ya from tripping and present ya spotless in blazing shine with major joy —
 25. to God our Savior, the max Wise — glory, majesty, reign, and power levels, now and forever. Facts, no cap.
