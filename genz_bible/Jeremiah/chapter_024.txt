# Jeremiah Chapter 24

  1. Yahweh showed me, and check this out, two baskets of figs set before the God's house of Yahweh, after that Nebuchadnezzar ruler of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, ruler of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
  2. One basket had hella fire figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had hella trash figs, which could not be eaten, they were so trash.
  3. then Yahweh said to me, What do you check it out, Jeremiah? I said, Figs; the fire figs, hella fire; and the trash, hella trash, that can’t be eaten, they are so trash.
  4. The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
  5. Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Like these fire figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for fire.
  6. For I will set my eyes on them for fire, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will put together them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
  7. I will hook it up them a heart to get it me, that I am Yahweh: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
  8. As the trash figs, which can’t be eaten, they are so trash, surely thus says Yahweh, So will I hook it up up Zedekiah the ruler of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt,
  9. I will even hook it up them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.
 10. I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.
