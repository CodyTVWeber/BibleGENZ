# Jeremiah Chapter 1

  1. The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
  2. to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, ruler of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
  3. It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, ruler of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, ruler of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
  4. now the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
  5. “Before I formed ya in the belly, I knew ya. Before ya came forth out of the womb, I sanctified ya. I have appointed ya a God's messenger to the nations.”
  6. then I said, “Ah, boss Yahweh! check this out,, I don’t get it how to spill the tea; for I am a child.”
  7. But Yahweh said to me, “Don’t say, ‘I am a child;’ for to whoever I shall send ya, ya shall slide, and whatever I shall command ya, ya shall spill the tea.
  8. Don’t be scared cuz of them; for I am with ya to deliver ya,” says Yahweh.
  9. then Yahweh put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Yahweh said to me, “check this out,, I have put my words in your mouth.
 10. check this out,, I have this day set ya over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to tear down and to overthrow, to put together and to plant.”
 11. Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do ya check it out?” I said, “I check it out a branch of an almond tree.”
 12. then Yahweh said to me, “ya have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it.”
 13. The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying, “What do ya check it out?” I said, “I check it out a boiling caldron; and it is tipping away from the north.”
 14. then Yahweh said to me, “Out of the north evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land.
 15. For, check this out,, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says Yahweh; “and they shall come through, and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.
 16. I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
 17. “ya so basically put your belt on your waist, arise, and spill the tea to them all that I command ya. Don’t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay ya before them.
 18. For, check this out,, I have made ya this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.
 19. They will fight against ya; but they won't prevail against ya; for I am with ya,” says Yahweh, “to deliver ya.”
