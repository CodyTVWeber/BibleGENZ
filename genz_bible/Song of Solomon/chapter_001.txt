# Song of Solomon Chapter 1

  1. The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s.
  2. Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for your show love is better than wine.
  3. Your oils have a pleasing fragrance. Your name is oil poured forth, so basically the virgins show love you.
  4. grab me away with you. Let us hurry. The ruler has brought me into his rooms. We will be glad and be hyped in you. We will praise your show love more than wine! They are right to show love you.
  5. I am dark, but lovely, you daughters of Jerusalem, like Kedar’s tents, like Solomon’s curtains.
  6. Don’t stare at me cuz I am dark, cuz the sun has scorched me. My mother’s sons were mad salty with me. They made me keeper of the vineyards. I haven’t kept my own vineyard.
  7. Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you graze your flock, where you rest them at noon; For why should I be as one who is veiled beside the flocks of your companions?
  8. If you don’t get it, most snatched among women, roll with the tracks of the sheep. Graze your young goats beside the shepherds’ tents.
  9. I have compared you, my show love, to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.
 10. Your cheeks are snatched with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.
 11. We will create you earrings of gold, with studs of silver.
 12. While the ruler sat at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
 13. My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh, that lies between my breasts.
 14. My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.
 15. check this out, you are snatched, my show love. check this out, you are snatched. Your eyes are doves.
 16. check this out, you are snatched, my beloved, yes, pleasant; and our couch is verdant.
 17. The beams of our house are cedars. Our rafters are firs.
