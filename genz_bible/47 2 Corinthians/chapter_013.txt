# 2 Corinthians Chapter 13

  1. This is the third time I am coming to ya. “At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.”
  2. I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, I write to those who have sinned before now, and to all the rest, that, if I come through again, I won't spare;
  3. seeing that ya seek a proof of the huge set apart who speaks in me; who toward ya isn't not it, but is powerful in ya.
  4. For he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God. For we also are not it in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward ya.
  5. Test your own selves, whether ya are in the trusting the process. Test your own selves. Or don’t ya get it as to your own selves, that Jesus the huge set apart is in ya?—unless facts ya are disqualified.
  6. But I hope that ya will get it that we aren’t disqualified.
  7. now I pray to God that ya do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ya may do that which is honorable, though we are as reprobate.
  8. For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
  9. For we be hyped when we are not it and ya are built different. And this we also pray for, even your perfecting.
 10. For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present, according to the authority which the boss gave me for building up, and not for tearing down.
 11. Finally, brothers, be hyped. Be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of show love and peace will be with ya.
 12. Greet one another with a set apart kiss.
 13. All the set apart fam greet ya.
 14. The God's show love of the boss Jesus the huge set apart, the show love of God, and the fellowship of the set apart Spirit, be with ya all. facts.
