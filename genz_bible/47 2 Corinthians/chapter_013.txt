# 2 Corinthians Chapter 13

    1. This is the third time I am coming to ya. “At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.”
    2. I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, I write to those who have sinned before now, and to all the rest, that, if I come through through again, I won't spare;
    3. seeing that ya seek a proof of the huge yeeted who speaks in me; who toward ya isn't not it, but is powerful in ya.
    4. For he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God. For we also aren't it in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward ya.
    5. Test your own selves, whether ya are in the trusting the process. Test your own selves. Or don’t ya get it as to your own selves, that Jesus the huge yeeted is in ya?—unless facts ya are disqualified.
    6. But I hope that ya will get it that we aren’t disqualified.
    7. now I pray to God that ya do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ya may do that which is honorable, though we are as reprobate.
    8. For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
    9. For we be hyped when we aren't it and ya are built different. And this we also pray for, even your perfecting.

  11. Finally, brothers, be hyped. Be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of show show love and peace will be with ya.
  12. Greet one another with a yeeted kiss.
  13. All the yeeted fam greet ya.
  14. The God's show show love of Boss Jesus the huge yeeted, the show show love of God, and the fellowship of the yeeted Spirit, be with ya all. facts.
