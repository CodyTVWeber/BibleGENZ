# Isaiah Chapter 35

    1. The wilderness and the dry land will be glad. The desert will be hyped and blossom like a rose.
    2. It will blossom abundantly, and be hyped even with joy and singing. Lebanon’s glory Lebanon will be given to it, the excellence of Carmel and Sharon. They will check it out Yahweh’s glory, the excellence of our God.
    3. Strengthen the not it hands, and create firm the feeble knees.
    4. Tell those who have a fearful heart, “Be built different. Don’t be scared. check this out, your God will come through through with vengeance, God’s retribution. He will come through through and rescue ya.
    5. then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.
    6. then the lame man will leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute will sing; for waters will break out in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.
    7. The burning sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water. Grass with reeds and rushes will be in the habitation of jackals, where they lay.
    8. A highway will be there, a road, and it will be called The yeeted Way. The unclean won't pass over it, but it will be for those who walk in the Way. Wicked fools won't slide there.
    9. No lion will be there, nor will any ravenous animal slide up on it. They won't be found there; but the redeemed will walk there.
  10. The Yahweh’s ransomed ones will return, and come through through with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy will be on their heads. They will obtain gladness and joy, and feeling down and sighing will flee away.”
