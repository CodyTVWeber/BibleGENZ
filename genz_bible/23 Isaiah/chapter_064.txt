# Isaiah Chapter 64

    1. Oh that ya would tear the heavens, that ya would come through through down, that the mountains might quake at your presence,
    2. as when fire kindles the brushwood, and the fire causes the waters to boil; to create your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!
    3. When ya did awesome things which we didn’t look for, ya came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
    4. For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen a God besides ya, who works for him who waits for him.
    5. ya meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember ya in your ways. check this out, ya were mad salty, and we sinned. We have been in messing up for a long time; and shall we be saved?
    6. For we have all become as one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is as a polluted garment: and we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, grab us away.
    7. there is none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself to grab hold of ya; for ya have hidden your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.
    8. But now, Yahweh, ya are our Father; we are the clay, and ya our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.
    9. Don’t be furious, Yahweh, neither remember iniquity forever: check it out, look, we beg ya, we are all your people.
  10. Your yeeted cities are become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
  11. Our yeeted and our snatched house, where our fathers praised ya, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.
  12. Will ya refrain yourself for these things, Yahweh? Will ya hold your peace, and afflict us hella severely?
