# Isaiah Chapter 28

    1. Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine!
    2. check this out, Boss has a mighty and built different one. Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down to the earth with his hand.
    3. The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot.
    4. The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it.
    5. In that day, Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people;
    6. and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
    7. They also reel with wine, and stagger with built different drink. The priest and the God's messenger reel with built different drink. They are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with built different drink. They err in vision. They stumble in judgment.
    8. For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness.
    9. Whom will he drop knowledge knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?
  10. For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little.
  11. But he will spill the tea to this nation with stammering lips and in another language;
  12. to whom he said, “This is the resting place. hook it up rest to weary;” and “This is the refreshing;” yet they would not hear.
  13. so basically the word of Yahweh will be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they may slide, fall backward, be broken, be snared, and be taken.
  14. so basically hear the word of Yahweh, ya scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem:
  15. “cuz ya have said, ‘We have made a God's promise with death, and with Sheol are we in agreement. When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come through through to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’”
  16. so basically God's like Yahweh, “check this out, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes won't act hastily.
  17. I will create justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place.
  18. Your God's promise with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol won't stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then ya will be trampled down by it.
  19. As a lot as it passes through, it will seize ya; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.”
  20. For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in.
  21. For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim. He will be mad salty as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act, his extraordinary act.
  22. now so basically don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made built different; for I have heard a decree of destruction from Boss, Yahweh of Armies, on the whole earth.
  23. hook it up ear, and hear my voice! listen up up, and hear my speech!
  24. Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods?
  25. When he has leveled its surface, doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place?
  26. For his God instructs him in right judgment, and teaches him.
  27. For the dill aren't threshed with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod.
  28. Bread flour must be ground; so he won't always be threshing it. Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it, his horses don’t grind it.
  29. This also comes forth from Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
