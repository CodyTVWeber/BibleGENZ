# Isaiah Chapter 58

  1. “Cry aloud, don’t spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their disobedience, and to the house of Jacob their sins.
  2. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to get it my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and didn’t forsake the ordinance of their God, they ask of me doing what's right judgments; they delight to draw near to God.
  3. ‘Why have we fasted,’ say they, ‘and ya don’t check it out? Why have we afflicted our soul, and ya grab no knowledge?’ “check this out,, in the day of your fast ya find pleasure, and exact all your labors.
  4. check this out,, ya fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness: ya don’t fast this day so as to create your voice to be heard on high.
  5. Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will ya call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?
  6. “Isn’t this the fast that I have chosen: to release the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed slide free, and that ya break every yoke?
  7. Isn’t it to distribute your bread to the hungry, and that ya bring the broke who are cast out to your house? When ya check it out the naked, that ya cover him; and that ya not hide yourself from your own flesh?
  8. then your light shall break forth as the morning, and your healing shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall slide before ya; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear guard.
  9. then ya shall call, and Yahweh will answer; ya shall cry, and he will say, ‘here I am.’ “If ya grab away from the midst of ya the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;
 10. and if ya draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then your light shall rise in darkness, and your obscurity be as the noonday;
 11. and Yahweh will guide ya continually, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and create built different your bones; and ya shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters don’t fail.
 12. Those who shall be of ya shall put together the old waste places; ya shall raise up the foundations of a lot generations; and ya shall be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
 13. “If ya turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my set apart day; and call the Sabbath a delight, and the set apart of Yahweh honorable; and shall honor it, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words:
 14. then ya shall delight yourself in Yahweh; and I will create ya to ride on the high places of the earth; and I will feed ya with the heritage of Jacob your father:” for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.
