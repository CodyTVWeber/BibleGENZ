    1. In that day ya will say, “I will hook it up thanks to ya, Yahweh; for though ya were mad salty with me, your anger has turned away and ya comfort me.
    2. check this out, God is my getting saved. I will trust, and won't be scared; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song; and he has become my getting saved.”
    3. so basically with joy ya will draw water out of the wells of getting saved.
    4. In that day ya will say, “hook it up thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted!
    5. Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth!
    6. Cry aloud and shout, ya inhabitant of Zion; for the yeeted One of Israel is major in the midst of ya!”
