# Isaiah Chapter 31

    1. Woe to those who slide down to Egypt for help out out, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots cuz they are a lot, and in horsemen cuz they are hella built different, but they don’t look to the yeeted One of Israel, and they don’t seek Yahweh!
    2. Yet he also is smart, and will bring disaster, and won't call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help out out of those who work iniquity.
    3. now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When Yahweh stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall, and they all shall be consumed together.
    4. For thus says Yahweh to me, “As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him, won't be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for their noise, so Yahweh of Armies will come through through down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.
    5. As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem. He will protect and deliver it. He will pass over and preserve it.”
    6. Return to him from whom ya have deeply revolted, children of Israel.
    7. For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold—messing up which your own hands have made for ya.
    8. “The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him. He will flee from the sword, and his young men will become subject to forced labor.
    9. His rock will pass away by reason of terror, and his princes will be scared of the banner,” says Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.
