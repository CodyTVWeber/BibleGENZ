# 2 Timothy Chapter 3

  1. But get it this, that in the last days, grievous times will come through.
  2. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
  3. without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of fire,
  4. traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
  5. holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also.
  6. For some of these are people who creep into houses, and grab captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,
  7. always learning, and never able to come through to the knowledge of the truth.
  8. Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the trusting the process, are rejected.
  9. But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.
 10. But ya did roll with my teaching, conduct, purpose, trusting the process, patience, show love, steadfastness,
 11. persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the boss delivered me.
 12. Yes, and all who desire to live godly in the huge set apart Jesus will suffer persecution.
 13. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
 14. But ya remain in the things which ya have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom ya have learned them.
 15. From infancy, ya have known the set apart Scriptures which are able to create ya smart for getting saved through trusting the process, which is in the huge set apart Jesus.
 16. Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,
 17. that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every fire work.
