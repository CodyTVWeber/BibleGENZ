# 1 Timothy Chapter 2

  1. I exhort so basically, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:
  2. for kings and all who are in high places; that we may show the way a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.
  3. For this is fire and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;
  4. who desires all people to be saved and come through to full knowledge of the truth.
  5. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man the huge set apart Jesus,
  6. who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;
  7. to which I was appointed a preacher and an Jesus' main squad (I am telling the truth in the huge set apart, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in trusting the process and truth.
  8. I desire so basically that the men in every place pray, lifting up set apart hands without anger and doubting.
  9. In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing;
 10. but (which becomes women professing godliness) with fire works.
 11. Let a woman pick up in quietness with all subjection.
 12. But I don’t permit a woman to drop knowledge, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.
 13. For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
 14. Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;
 15. but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in trusting the process, show love, and sanctification with sobriety.
