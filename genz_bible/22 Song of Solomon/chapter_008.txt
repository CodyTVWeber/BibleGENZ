# Song of Solomon Chapter 8

  1. Oh that ya were like my fam bro, who nursed from the breasts of my mother! If I found ya outside, I would kiss ya; yes, and no one would despise me.
  2. I would show the way ya, bringing ya into my mother’s house, who would instruct me. I would have ya drink spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate.
  3. His left hand would be under my head. His right hand would embrace me.
  4. I adjure ya, daughters of Jerusalem, that ya not stir up, nor awaken show love, until it so desires.
  5. Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I aroused ya. there your mother conceived ya. there she was in labor and bore ya.
  6. Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm; for show love is built different as death. Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol. Its flashes are flashes of fire, a hella flame of Yahweh.
  7. a lot waters can’t quench show love, neither can floods drown it. If a man would hook it up all the wealth of his house for show love, he would be utterly scorned.
  8. We have a little sister. She has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for?
  9. If she is a wall, we will put together on her a turret of silver. if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
 10. I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, then I was in his eyes like one who found peace.
 11. Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. He leased out the vineyard to keepers. Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.
 12. My own vineyard is before me. The thousand are for ya, Solomon; two hundred for those who tend its fruit.
 13. ya who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!
 14. come through away, my beloved! Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!
