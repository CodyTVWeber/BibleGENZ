# Matthew Chapter 23

  1. then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
  2. saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses’ seat.
  3. All things so basically whatever they tell ya to observe, observe and do, but don’t do their works; for they say, and don’t do.
  4. For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves won't lift a finger to help out them.
  5. But all their works they do to be seen by men. They create their phylacteries broad, enlarge the fringes of their garments,
  6. and show love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,
  7. the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘teacher, teacher’ by men.
  8. But don’t ya be called ‘teacher,’ for one is your teacher, the the huge set apart, and all of ya are brothers.
  9. Call no man on the earth your father, for one is your Father, he who is in heaven.
 10. Neither be called masters, for one is your boss, the the huge set apart.
 11. But he who is greatest among ya will be your helper.
 12. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
 13. “Woe to ya, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ya devour widows’ houses, and as a pretense ya create long prayers. so basically ya will receive greater condemnation.
 14. “But woe to ya, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! cuz ya shut up the God's squad of Heaven against men; for ya don’t enter in yourselves, neither do ya allow those who are entering in to enter.
 15. Woe to ya, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ya travel around by sea and land to create one proselyte; and when he becomes one, ya create him twice as much of a son of Gehenna as yourselves.
 16. “Woe to ya, ya blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the God's house, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the God's house, he is obligated.’
 17. ya blind fools! For which is greater, the gold, or the God's house that sanctifies the gold?
 18. ‘Whoever swears by the prayer spot, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated?’
 19. ya blind fools! For which is greater, the gift, or the prayer spot that sanctifies the gift?
 20. He so basically who swears by the prayer spot, swears by it, and by everything on it.
 21. He who swears by the God's house, swears by it, and by him who was living in it.
 22. He who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it.
 23. “Woe to ya, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ya tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and trusting the process. But ya ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.
 24. ya blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!
 25. “Woe to ya, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ya clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness.
 26. ya blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that its outside may become clean also.
 27. “Woe to ya, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ya are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear snatched, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
 28. Even so ya also outwardly appear doing what's right to men, but inwardly ya are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
 29. “Woe to ya, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ya put together the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the doing what's right,
 30. and say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we wouldn’t have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.’
 31. so basically ya testify to yourselves that ya are children of those who killed the prophets.
 32. Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.
 33. ya serpents, ya offspring of vipers, how will ya escape the judgment of Gehenna?
 34. so basically, check this out,, I send to ya prophets, smart men, and scribes. Some of them ya will kill and crucify; and some of them ya will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;
 35. that on ya may come through all the doing what's right blood shed on the earth, from the blood of doing what's right Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ya killed between the sanctuary and the prayer spot.
 36. Most for sure I tell ya, all these things will come through upon this generation.
 37. “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How a lot I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and ya would not!
 38. check this out,, your house is left to ya desolate.
 39. For I tell ya, ya won't check it out me from now on, until ya say, ‘blessed up is he who comes in the name of the boss!’”
