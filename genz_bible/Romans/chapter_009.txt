# Romans Chapter 9

  1. I tell the truth in the huge set apart. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the set apart Spirit,
  2. that I have major feeling down and unceasing pain in my heart.
  3. For I could wish that I myself were accursed from the huge set apart for my brothers’ sake, my relatives according to the flesh,
  4. who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;
  5. of whom are the fathers, and from whom is the huge set apart as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed up forever. facts.
  6. But it isn't as though the word of God has come through to nothing. For they aren't all Israel, that are of Israel.
  7. Neither, cuz they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children. But, “In Isaac will your seed be called.”
  8. That is, it isn't the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.
  9. For this is a word of promise, “At the appointed time I will come through, and Sarah will have a son.”
 10. Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.
 11. For being not yet born, neither having done anything fire or trash, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,
 12. it was said to her, “The elder will help out out the younger.”
 13. Even as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
 14. What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be!
 15. For he said to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
 16. So then it isn't of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.
 17. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this hella purpose I caused ya to be raised up, that I might show in ya my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”
 18. So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.
 19. ya will say then to me, “Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?”
 20. But facts, O man, who are ya to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, “Why did ya create me like this?”
 21. Or hasn’t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to create one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?
 22. What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to create his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,
 23. and that he might create known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,
 24. us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?
 25. As he says also in Hosea, “I will call them ‘my people,’ which were not my people; and her ‘beloved,’ who was not beloved.”
 26. “It will be that in the place where it was said to them, ‘ya aren't my people,’ there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”
 27. Isaiah cries concerning Israel, “If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant who will be saved;
 28. for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, cuz the boss will create a short work upon the earth.”
 29. As Isaiah has said before, “Unless the boss of Armies had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah.”
 30. What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn’t roll with after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of trusting the process;
 31. but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn’t arrive at the law of righteousness.
 32. Why? cuz they didn’t seek it by trusting the process, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;
 33. even as it is written, “check this out,, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.”
