# Romans Chapter 15

  1. now we who are built different ought to bear the weaknesses of the not it, and not to please ourselves.
  2. Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is fire, to be building him up.
  3. For even anointed one didn’t please himself. But, as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.”
  4. For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that through patience and through encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
  5. now the God of patience and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to anointed one Jesus,
  6. that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our boss Jesus anointed one.
  7. so basically accept one another, even as anointed one also accepted you, to the glory of God.
  8. now I say that anointed one has been made a helper of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers,
  9. and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, “so basically will I hook it up praise to you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.”
 10. Again he says, “be hyped, you Gentiles, with his people.”
 11. Again, “Praise the boss, all you Gentiles! Let all the peoples praise him.”
 12. Again, Isaiah says, “there will be the root of Jesse, he who arises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles will hope.”
 13. now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, in the power of the set apart Spirit.
 14. I myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.
 15. But I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, cuz of the God's show love that was given to me by God,
 16. that I should be a helper of anointed one Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest the fire News of God, that the giving to God up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the set apart Spirit.
 17. I have so basically my boasting in anointed one Jesus in things pertaining to God.
 18. For I will not dare to spill the tea of any things except those which anointed one worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
 19. in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God’s Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the fire News of anointed one;
 20. yes, making it my aim to preach the fire News, not where anointed one was already named, that I might not put together on another’s foundation.
 21. But, as it is written, “They will check it out, to whom no news of him came. They who haven’t heard will understand.”
 22. so basically also I was hindered these a lot times from coming to you,
 23. but now, no longer having any place in these regions, and having these a lot years a longing to come through to you,
 24. whenever I journey to Spain, I will come through to you. For I hope to check it out you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.
 25. But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.
 26. For it has been the fire pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to create a certain contribution for the broke among the saints who are at Jerusalem.
 27. Yes, it has been their fire pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to help out them in fleshly things.
 28. When so basically I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will slide on by way of you to Spain.
 29. I get it that, when I come through to you, I will come through in the fullness of the blessing of the fire News of anointed one.
 30. now I beg you, brothers, by our boss Jesus anointed one, and by the show love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,
 31. that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;
 32. that I may come through to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest.
 33. now the God of peace be with you all. facts.
