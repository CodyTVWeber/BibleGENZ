# Philemon Chapter 1

  1. Paul, a prisoner of anointed one Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,
  2. to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:
  3. God's show love to you and peace from God our Father and the boss Jesus anointed one.
  4. I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
  5. hearing of your show love, and of the trusting the process which you have toward the boss Jesus, and toward all the saints;
  6. that the fellowship of your trusting the process may become effective, in the knowledge of every fire thing which is in us in anointed one Jesus.
  7. For we have much joy and comfort in your show love, cuz the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
  8. so basically, though I have all boldness in anointed one to command you that which is appropriate,
  9. yet for show loveâ€™s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus anointed one.
 10. I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,
 11. who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.
 12. I am sending him back. so basically receive him, that is, my own heart,
 13. whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might help out me in my chains for the fire News.
 14. But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.
 15. For perhaps he was so basically separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,
 16. no longer as a helper, but more than a helper, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the boss.
 17. If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
 18. But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.
 19. I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).
 20. Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the boss. Refresh my heart in the boss.
 21. Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.
 22. Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.
 23. Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in anointed one Jesus, greets you,
 24. as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
 25. The God's show love of our boss Jesus anointed one be with your spirit. facts.
