# Isaiah Chapter 6

  1. In the year that ruler Uzziah died, I checked out the boss sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the God's house.
  2. Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.
  3. One called to another, and said, “set apart, set apart, set apart, is Yahweh of Armies! The whole earth is full of his glory!”
  4. The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
  5. then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, cuz I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the ruler, Yahweh of Armies!”
  6. then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the prayer spot.
  7. He touched my mouth with it, and said, “check this out, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your messing up forgiven.”
  8. I heard the boss’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will slide for us?” then I said, “here I am. Send me!”
  9. He said, “slide, and tell this people, ‘You hear facts, but don’t understand; and you check it out facts, but don’t perceive.’
 10. create the heart of this people fat. create their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they check it out with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.”
 11. then I said, “boss, how long?” He answered, “Until cities are waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land becomes utterly waste,
 12. And Yahweh has removed men far away, and the forsaken places are a lot in the midst of the land.
 13. If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled; so the set apart seed is its stock.”
