# Isaiah Chapter 10

  1. Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers who write oppressive decrees;
  2. to deprive the needy from justice, and to rob the broke among my people of their rights, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may create the fatherless their prey!
  3. What will ya do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which will come through from afar? To whom will ya flee for help out? Where will ya leave your wealth?
  4. They will only bow down under the prisoners, and will fall under the slain. For all this his anger isn't turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
  5. Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation!
  6. I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people who anger me will I hook it up him a command to grab the spoil and to grab the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
  7. but like he doesn’t mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to tear down, and to cut off not a not much nations.
  8. For he says, “Aren’t all of my princes kings?
  9. Isn’t Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like Damascus?”
 10. As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
 11. shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
 12. so basically it will happen that, when the boss has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the ruler of Assyria, and the insolence of his haughty looks.
 13. For he has said, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding: and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.
 14. My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, have I gathered all the earth. there was no one who moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped.”
 15. Should an axe brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up someone who isn't wood.
 16. so basically the boss, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire.
 17. The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his set apart One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.
 18. He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when a standard bearer faints.
 19. The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be not much, so that a child could write their number.
 20. It will come through to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on Yahweh, the set apart One of Israel, in truth.
 21. A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
 22. For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.
 23. For the boss, Yahweh of Armies, will create a full end, and that determined, in the midst of all the earth.
 24. so basically the boss, Yahweh of Armies, says “My people who dwell in Zion, don’t be scared of the Assyrian, though he strike ya with the rod, and lift up his staff against ya, as Egypt did.
 25. For yet a hella little while, and the indignation against ya will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed to his destruction.”
 26. Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt.
 27. It will happen in that day, that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed cuz of the anointing oil.
 28. He has come through to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage.
 29. They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled.
 30. Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim! listen up, Laishah! ya broke Anathoth!
 31. Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
 32. This hella day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
 33. check this out,, the boss, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.
 34. He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
