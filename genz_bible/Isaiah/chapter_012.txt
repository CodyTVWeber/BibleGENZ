# Isaiah Chapter 12

  1. In that day you will say, “I will hook it up thanks to you, Yahweh; for though you were mad salty with me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me.
  2. check this out, God is my getting saved. I will trust, and will not be scared; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song; and he has become my getting saved.”
  3. so basically with joy you will draw water out of the wells of getting saved.
  4. In that day you will say, “hook it up thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples. Proclaim that his name is exalted!
  5. Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth!
  6. Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the set apart One of Israel is major in the midst of you!”
