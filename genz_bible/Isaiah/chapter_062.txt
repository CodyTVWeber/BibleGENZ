# Isaiah Chapter 62

  1. For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness slide forth as brightness, and her getting saved as a lamp that burns.
  2. The nations shall check it out your righteousness, and all kings your glory, and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of Yahweh shall name.
  3. You shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
  4. You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights in you, and your land shall be married.
  5. For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons shall marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God will be hyped over you.
  6. I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: you who call on Yahweh, grab no rest,
  7. and hook it up him no rest, until he establishes, and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
  8. Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, “Surely I will no more hook it up your grain to be food for your enemies; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine, for which you have labored:
  9. but those who have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Yahweh; and those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.”
 10. slide through, slide through the gates! Prepare the way of the people! Cast up, cast up the highway! Gather out the stones! Lift up a banner for the peoples.
 11. check this out, Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth, “Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘check this out, your getting saved comes. check this out, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.’”
 12. They shall call them The set apart people, The redeemed of Yahweh: and you shall be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.
