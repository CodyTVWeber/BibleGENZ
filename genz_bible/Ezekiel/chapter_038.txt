# Ezekiel Chapter 38

  1. The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
  2. Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
  3. and say, God's like Yahweh: check this out, I am against you, Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
  4. and I will turn you around, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you forth, with all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a major company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords;
  5. Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
  6. Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even a lot peoples with you.
  7. Be prepared, yes, prepare yourself, you, and all your companies who are assembled to you, and be a guard to them.
  8. After a lot days you shall be visited: in the latter years you shall come through into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of a lot peoples, on the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.
  9. You shall ascend, you shall come through like a storm, you shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your hordes, and a lot peoples with you.
 10. God's like Yahweh: It shall happen in that day, that things shall come through into your mind, and you shall devise an evil device:
 11. and you shall say, I will slide up to the land of unwalled villages; I will slide to those who are at rest, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;
 12. to grab the spoil and to grab the prey; to turn your hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and against the people who are gathered out of the nations, who have gotten livestock and goods, who dwell in the middle of the earth.
 13. Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions of it, shall tell you, Have you come through to grab the spoil? have you assembled your company to grab the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to grab away livestock and goods, to grab major spoil?
 14. so basically, son of man, prophesy, and tell Gog, God's like Yahweh: In that day when my people Israel dwells securely, shall you not get it it?
 15. You shall come through from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you, and a lot peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a major company and a mighty army;
 16. and you shall come through up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall happen in the latter days, that I will bring you against my land, that the nations may get it me, when I shall be sanctified in you, Gog, before their eyes.
 17. God's like Yahweh: Are you he of whom I spoke in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for a lot years that I would bring you against them?
 18. It shall happen in that day, when Gog shall come through against the land of Israel, says the boss Yahweh, that my wrath shall come through up into my nostrils.
 19. For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a major shaking in the land of Israel;
 20. so that the fish of the sea, and the birds of the sky, and the animals of the field, and all creeping things who creep on the earth, and all the men who are on the surface of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
 21. I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains, says the boss Yahweh: every manâ€™s sword shall be against his brother.
 22. With pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him; and I will rain on him, and on his hordes, and on the a lot peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower, and major hailstones, fire, and sulfur.
 23. I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will create myself known in the eyes of a lot nations; and they shall get it that I am Yahweh.
