# Ezekiel Chapter 2

  1. He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will spill the tea with ya.
  2. The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.
  3. He said to me, Son of man, I send ya to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this hella day.
  4. The children are impudent and stiff-hearted: I am sending ya to them; and ya shall tell them, God's like Yahweh.
  5. They, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall get it that there has been a God's messenger among them.
  6. ya, son of man, don’t be scared of them, neither be scared of their words, though briers and thorns are with ya, and ya do dwell among scorpions: don’t be scared of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
  7. ya shall spill the tea my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.
  8. But ya, son of man, hear what I tell ya; don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that which I hook it up ya.
  9. When I looked, check this out,, a hand was put forth to me; and, check this out,, a scroll of a book was therein;
 10. He spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
