# Ezekiel Chapter 37

  1. The hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.
  2. He caused me to pass by them all around: and check this out, there were hella a lot in the open valley; and check this out, they were hella dry.
  3. He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? I answered, boss Yahweh, you get it.
  4. Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, you dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh.
  5. God's like Yahweh to these bones: check this out, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.
  6. I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall get it that I am Yahweh.
  7. So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and check this out, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
  8. I checked out, and, check this out, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.
  9. then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, God's like Yahweh: come through from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.
 10. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly major army.
 11. then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: check this out, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.
 12. so basically prophesy, and tell them, God's like Yahweh: check this out, I will open your graves, and cause you to come through up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
 13. You shall get it that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come through up out of your graves, my people.
 14. I will put my Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and you shall get it that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and performed it, says Yahweh.
 15. The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
 16. You, son of man, grab one stick, and write on it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then grab another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:
 17. and join them for you one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.
 18. When the children of your people shall spill the tea to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?
 19. tell them, God's like Yahweh: check this out, I will grab the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, even with the stick of Judah, and create them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
 20. The sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.
 21. Say to them, God's like Yahweh: check this out, I will grab the children of Israel from among the nations, where they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
 22. and I will create them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one ruler shall be ruler to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;
 23. neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will rescue them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
 24. My helper David shall be ruler over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.
 25. They shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my helper, in which your fathers lived; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their childrenâ€™s children, forever: and David my helper shall be their prince for ever.
 26. Moreover I will create a God's promise of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting God's promise with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore.
 27. My tent also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
 28. The nations shall get it that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in their midst forevermore.
