# 1 Thessalonians Chapter 1

  1. Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the boss Jesus anointed one: God's show love to you and peace from God our Father and the boss Jesus anointed one.
  2. We always hook it up thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,
  3. remembering without ceasing your work of trusting the process and labor of show love and patience of hope in our boss Jesus anointed one, before our God and Father.
  4. We get it, brothers loved by God, that you are chosen,
  5. and that our fire News came to you not in word only, but also in power, and in the set apart Spirit, and with much assurance. You get it what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake.
  6. You became imitators of us, and of the boss, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the set apart Spirit,
  7. so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
  8. For from you what God was like has been declared, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your trusting the process toward God has gone out; so that we need not to say anything.
  9. For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you; and how you turned to God from idols, to help out a living and true God,
 10. and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the deadâ€”Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come through.
