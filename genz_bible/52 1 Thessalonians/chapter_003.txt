# 1 Thessalonians Chapter 3

  1. so basically, when we couldn’t stand it any longer, we thought it fire to be left behind at Athens alone,
  2. and sent Timothy, our fam bro and God’s helper in the fire News of the huge set apart, to establish ya, and to comfort ya concerning your trusting the process;
  3. that no one be moved by these afflictions. For ya get it that we are appointed to this task.
  4. For most for sure, when we were with ya, we told ya beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened, and ya get it.
  5. For this cause I also, when I couldn’t stand it any longer, sent that I might get it your trusting the process, for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted ya, and our labor would have been in vain.
  6. But when Timothy came just now to us from ya, and brought us glad news of your trusting the process and show love, and that ya have fire memories of us always, longing to check it out us, even as we also long to check it out ya;
  7. for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over ya in all our distress and affliction through your trusting the process.
  8. For now we live, if ya stand fast in the boss.
  9. For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for ya, for all the joy with which we be hyped for your sakes before our God;
 10. night and day praying exceedingly that we may check it out your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your trusting the process?
 11. now may our God and Father himself, and our boss Jesus the huge set apart, direct our way to ya;
 12. and the boss create ya to increase and abound in show love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward ya,
 13. to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our boss Jesus with all his set apart fam.
