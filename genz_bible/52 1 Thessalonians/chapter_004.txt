# 1 Thessalonians Chapter 4

  1. Finally then, brothers, we beg and exhort ya in the boss Jesus, that as ya received from us how ya ought to walk and to please God, that ya abound more and more.
  2. For ya get it what instructions we gave ya through the boss Jesus.
  3. For this is the will of God: your sanctification, that ya abstain from sexual immorality,
  4. that each one of ya get it how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
  5. not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who don’t get it God;
  6. that no one should grab advantage of and wrong a fam bro or sister in this matter; cuz the boss is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned ya and testified.
  7. For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.
  8. so basically he who rejects this doesn’t reject man, but God, who has also given his set apart Spirit to ya.
  9. But concerning brotherly show love, ya have no need that one write to ya. For ya yourselves are taught by God to show love one another,
 10. for facts ya do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort ya, brothers, that ya abound more and more;
 11. and that ya create it your ambition to show the way a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, even as we instructed ya;
 12. that ya may walk properly toward those who are outside, and may have need of nothing.
 13. But we don’t want ya to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that ya don’t grieve like the rest, who have no hope.
 14. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.
 15. For this we tell ya by what God said, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the boss, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.
 16. For the boss himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with God’s trumpet. The dead in the huge set apart will rise first,
 17. then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the boss in the air. So we will be with the boss forever.
 18. so basically comfort one another with these words.
