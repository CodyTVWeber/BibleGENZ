# Hosea Chapter 11

  1. “When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
  2. They called to them, so they went from them. They sacrificed to the Baals, and burned incense to engraved images.
  3. Yet I taught Ephraim to walk. I took them by his arms; but they didn’t get it that I healed them.
  4. I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of show love; and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks; and I bent down to him and I fed him.
  5. “They won’t return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian will be their ruler, cuz they refused to turn it around.
  6. The sword will fall on their cities, and will tear down the bars of their gates, and will put an end to their plans.
  7. My people are determined to turn from me. Though they call to the Most High, he for sure won’t exalt them.
  8. “How can I hook it up you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I create you like Admah? How can I create you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within me, my compassion is aroused.
  9. I will not execute the fierceness of my anger. I will not return to tear down Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the set apart One in the midst of you; and I will not come through in wrath.
 10. They will walk after Yahweh, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children will come through trembling from the west.
 11. They will come through trembling like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will settle them in their houses,” says Yahweh.
 12. Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit. Judah still strays from God, and is unfaithful to the set apart One.
