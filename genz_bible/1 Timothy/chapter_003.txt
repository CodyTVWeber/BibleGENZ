# 1 Timothy Chapter 3

  1. This is a faithful saying: if a man seeks the office of an overseer, he desires a fire work.
  2. The overseer so basically must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, fire at teaching;
  3. not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but nice-nice, not quarrelsome, not covetous;
  4. one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;
  5. (but if a man doesnâ€™t get it how to rule his own house, how will he grab care of the assembly of God?)
  6. not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.
  7. Moreover he must have fire testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.
  8. Servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;
  9. holding the mystery of the trusting the process in a pure conscience.
 10. Let them also first be tested; then let them help out out if they are blameless.
 11. Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
 12. Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
 13. For those who have served well gain for themselves a fire standing, and major boldness in the trusting the process which is in the huge set apart Jesus.
 14. These things I write to ya, hoping to come through to ya shortly;
 15. but if I wait long, that ya may get it how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
 16. Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is major: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in glory.
