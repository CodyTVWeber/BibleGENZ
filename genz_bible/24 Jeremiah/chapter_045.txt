    2. Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to ya, Baruch:
    3. ya said, Woe is me now! for Yahweh has added feeling down to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.
    4. ya shall tell him, Thus says Yahweh: check this out, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.
    5. Do ya seek major things for yourself? Donâ€™t seek them; for, check this out, I will bring evil on all flesh, says Yahweh; but your life will I hook it up to ya for a prey in all places where ya slide.
