# Ezekiel Chapter 15

    1. The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
    2. Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?
    3. Shall wood be taken of it to create any work? or will men grab a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
    4. check this out, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and its midst is burned: is it profitable for any work?
    5. check this out, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!
    6. so basically God's like Yahweh: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I hook it up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
    7. I will set my face against them; they shall slide forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ya shall get it that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.
    8. I will create the land desolate, cuz they have committed a trespass, says Boss Yahweh.
